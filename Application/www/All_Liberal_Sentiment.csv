>Claiming to be the party of values, conservatives have lined up behind someone who decries true faith, brutalizes the weak, unabashedly displays his racism and acts on every ugly impulse that pops into his head.

By and large they've always been hypocrites. All their bluster about personal responsibility, faith, and morality are nothing more than talking points, rather than a basis for actual policy positions. And what's worse is many of them know this, and the hypocrisy doesn't bother them one bit. Its a feature, not a bug.***

All the people who have been working for years to get states and the fed to fund early childhood learning are interested in long term economic success.

I think the big difference between republican economic success and democratic economic success is the the Republicans want open markets with no regulation or government interference and the democrats want good jobs with good pay, safe conditions and benefits for everyone.

Posting this stuff is what I’d do if I were an operative for the other side. Yeah, stay home, your side is totally gonna win, you don’t wanna wait in a long COVID-y line, DO YOU?

It’s a great prediction considering this prof’s  track record, but the only way it comes true is if people get off their duff and MAKE it true. Go vote. And then get your foot ready to put in someone’s ass if he refuses to leave. He CAN lose, but he can also win...if.

The Trump campaign already has all the dirt they need on him--they're just waiting till the unleash it. I hate to say it, but Trump will get the votes he needs.

His ""system"" is a series of highly subjective yes/no questions about each candidate, and his 2020 prediction relies on the answer being ""no"" to ""is Trump charismatic?"".***I'm cautiously optimistic. Anyone who voted for Clinton in 2016 is certainly not going to vote for Trump in 2020, but even though maybe most Trump supporters will still vote for him, some are disillusioned and will vote against him. Trump won by extremely narrow margins in Midwestern states, so it won't take many. Jill Stein is not running this time either, so she won't siphon off any votes from Biden. Kanye West is trying to take Stein's place, though. 

Something worrisome is that Trump is screwing with the USPS because he knows that there will be many mail-in ballots.***This is spam, but...

I hope the spam site is correct.***Keep in mind he said Al Gore was gonna win 2000***There's nothing wrong with focusing on the presidential election as long as we don't lose focus on the Senate and House races, and on the local races.

Mike Pence - 

- Oversaw cutting $1.18 million from state domestic violence funding as Governor
- Signed a bill banning abortions due to a non-viable fetus
- He opposes comprehensive immigration reform and birthright citizenship for many children born to immigrant parents.
- Signed the anti-LGBT bill that allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBT people.
- Sponsored the first bill to defund Planned Parenthood while in Congress.  He said “As long as they aspire to [provide abortion care] I’ll be after them.”
- Pence fought against suing Big Tobacco, saying “Smoking doesn’t kill”, and big tobacco paid him $125K
- Pence legalized guns on school property, and NRA paid him $50k.
- cancelled a free needle exchange program at the height of a heroin and AIDS crisis (causing a spike in AIDS in southern Indiana).
- As Governor signed a law that mandated that women give funeral services to an aborted fetus.
- Signed a bill to stop local minimum wage increases in Indiana.
- He lowered corporate taxes while cutting funding for higher education and pre-k
- Human-Caused Climate Change denier http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/5-real-things-mike-pence-has-said-about-climate-change/ and Big Oil paid him $300k
- “…accepting homosexuality will lead to societal collapse"" Speach to Republican Study Committee
- Voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act because gays are ""waging a war on freedom"".
- Opposes bathroom laws and gay adoption because being gay means you're also a pedophile.
- Supports conversion therapy and has supported laws to force the ADA & APA to recognize it as a medical procedure.
- Does not refute or speak out about trump's overt RACISM.***Thats. Mediocre.

Edit: To the right wing trolls replying and getting their messages deleted, there is a far right. You want to restrict women's healthcare, you want to keep the poor down, you want to ignore the science behind coronavirus protection. You want for profit healthcare. You think human beings lives are literally a for profit enterprise. You people are what is wrong with this country.******Yep a vote for a third party is a vote for Trump I was a Green until 2016 when I saw the Trump threat. I despise Clinton for several reasons but voted for her because I could see Trump for what he was, and he had exceeded my expectations four more years of this fool will be disastrous.***If we ever get rid of the EC, I think we need to change the presidency to be:

1)Non partisan primaries

2) November is a race between top two 2 candidates(run-off held in summer if necessary)

3) Single term for all Presidents, possible 6 or 8 years term though***You will never get a presidential candidate who is perfect and you agree with 100% of the time. If you wait for that you'll never vote for anyone.***I will vote Blue!***Funny how people still pretend that our votes count. Our votes are the popular vote. The person who lost the popular vote last election is now president. Vote, don't vote. Don't matter. The electoral college is the only thing that does.***Joe Biden wasn’t my first choice either, but my life has been negatively impacted by the current administration far too much for me to throw away my vote.***I hate Biden... but I will be voting against Trump which unfortunately means for Biden.

The GOP will be gutted in this election but the time for the Democratic party to 'drain the swamp' will come soon enough.***Politics is the art of compromise.  You never get everything you want, so you work towards getting the best that you can.

If you want to change the direction of the country then you need to start with the local offices, because it's the people who vote and he people won't vote for big changes without evidence that the changes will work***Conversely, if as many people actually voted third party as talked about it both the major parties could be removed.  I don't care how the system is set up, if a third party received the lions share of the votes they would be elected or as a people we could force the entire government out for election fraud***I think this is always going to be the problem with biden.

His candidacy seems to be primarily attractive ONLY because he is not trump.

I'm also not convinced that he would put a progressive on the SCOTUS.***Let's consider that voting is not a marriage - you can't wait for Mr/ Mrs ""Perfect"" or there's no deal. Voting is like public transportation. You get to the bus station and take whichever bus gets you closest to where you want to be. You don't sit home and sulk that no busses run to exact address you want to go to, and you don't take a completely different line that takes you in the opposite direction.***The last two elections is ""lesser of two evils"" which I am sick of.   I feel I am essentially voting for Kamala Harris for president, as Joe Biden will be 82 years old in 2024.   I'm voting Biden/Harris, but it sucks that the idiots in the Democratic Party give us an octogenarian whose career in the Senate was unimpressive for anyone with even a slight progressive slant.

But I'm voting for him.  Ugh.***I was going to vote 3rd party, until the pandemic hit, then it became ""Who did and who wouldn't have politicized proper PPE""? 160,000 dead because our current admin tried to downplay a pandemic and gave validity to conspiracy theorist and is now pushing kids to go back to school and as if to top it off the current acts of voter suppression through the USPS, Trump could be going up against a Turd Sandwich and I'd Vote for the Turd Sandwich.***We need to get rid of Trump so whatever, all aboard. But having 4 years to determine the best candidate to take down a truly awful opponent, and then coming up with Biden.... its likely to cost the democrats my support in 2024 unless they really impress. And even sadder, I can’t even think of a candidate that ran that I liked all that much AND think would be a slam dunk win against this terrible opponent. (Andrew Yang met the first part of that but not the second).

And man, if he steps down for a reason other than an unforeseen health event, I will be very upset.***Any leftist or independent that doesn't vote Biden is responsible for giving trump 4-more years.

I wasn't a Biden supporter in the beginning, and I'm not the biggest fan of Harris. But this is who we have. If you vote third party because of this you are giving Trump and his goons the election.

We’re never going to get away from this sess pool they call a Democracy if you try to lead people to believe there are only 2 people you can vote for. That’s why we have this problem in the first place. Conceding defeat doesn’t count as a win bc Trump, sorry.***People probably get tired of me saying this but I am beholden to no political party whether democrat, republican, left, right, middle, up, down, or even sideways. When I cast a vote, it is for performance, not the person.

If there were a truly viable 3rd party contender, then I would certainly consider them. I am not happy with any of the viable contenders, ie: our screwed up two man race. But I am also not here to stump for anyone. Ultimately it is up to the citizen to cast their own vote the way they see fit. However, both of the viable contenders are lack luster based on their prior performance.

And that is the key. We are supposed to be the government. 'The government' is not some entity out in space that is untouchable or unreachable and runs amuck as it's party so desires. We the people are the government. We make the rules. We set the standards. We, as employers, are supposed to make sure our employees are doing our bidding in an equitable and efficient manner. 

This notion that we elect a president merely because of their political affiliation is utter nonsense. Because what happens is, we will elect a Democrat president, they will do 'things' and then we elect a Republican president and they undo the 'things' the president before did. This is not progress. This is slow death with more steps.***This is the only reason I would vote Biden.***I will vote blue because it's obvious red doesn't hold any accountability against their own voted president.

Everyone stay safe. 😷🌊☑️***It’s not the ideal situation but I’ll take oatmeal in this case over the alternative***I feel like there are so many third party people who don’t vote for third party for this exact reason. Thus keeping us inprisoned to the 2 party system, both of whom frankly are not representatives of the people at all. Constantly forcing voters to choose lesser of 2 evils so to speak. America really needs more parties. There are not just 2 kinds of people here. And also would create competition among parties to raise the standards and bring forward better candidates. Ok, sure lets say you will get trump out of office for the up coming term, What about the next term and the term after that? You don’t think the opposing party won’t bring forward another shitty candidate that can exploit the voters emotion that will get them into office? Politicians are going to be politicians, when it comes to election time, they will all say the same things, “more jobs, better health care, must beat the other guy, america is at a fork in the road, history in the making blah blah”. Its the voters job to force a better standard and not just settle for your candidates.***Ya know the conservatives say the same shit the other way. In 2016 I was told by Trump supporters my 3rd party vote was for Hillary, as well as Hillary supporters saying I voted for Trump. Both parties are gonna throw this lame ass excuse out saying your vote is wasted an is supporting ""the other guy"" every time. Honestly I'm sure I'm not the only one sick of it. Voting for third party is NOT a vote for the other guy. It is by definition a vote for third party. The two party system has just continuously managed to convince people of this lie so they'll stay in power. If there really is this many people that are third party voters that need to be pushed to Democrat/Republican than maybe just maybe there's enough of us that if everyone quits lying to themselves we can actually get a third party in. Gary Johnson on the libertarian ticket managed to get on all 50 ballots. I think the last time that happened was 96 and that was the first time a third party ticket got on. Jill stein managed to be on 45 of the ballots. So two separate third party nominations managed to make serious enough momentum to be an option last election. There's enough of us sick of the two party system to tear it down and both sides know that so they send their supporters to tell everyone not to vote because its a vote for the ""other guy"". Enough is enough people.******This ticket is only acceptable because I'd rather we pressure these two to do their job than against Trump. They **might** have a small chance of discussing legal weed, public health programs, student debt, police brutality and climate change. 

I highly doubt it, but I'll let them make their case. Chances are they make things comfortable for the privileged while the rest of us struggle.***I get what you’re saying, and I’d vote Biden if I was in a state that Trump has a chance of winning, but I’m fortunate enough to be from a state that votes blue no matter who. I’m not gonna vote Biden when he’s pretty much already guaranteed to win where I’m at. My vote is going to Howie.***Biden isn’t really any different than Trump, he runs on a platform of people who just pretend they aren’t like him. Democrats and conservatives both just support corporations and billionaires, and while I am reluctant to vote outside the two parties, I can’t stand this bullshit and I want to support the possibility of better candidates.***trump is extremely bad and biden is quite bad. they aren’t good. both options are horrendous, but it’s sad that america is arguing which candidate is least bad than which candidate is better. voting biden won’t be good, but it’s the best that we can get. if we all rally together, we might be able to get trump out finally.***Beyond that, I have massive worries about the state of the economy for young people. 

To be frank, recessions are lost years for most young people as far as earning power goes. Money you will never recover. 

Simply put, trump could impact your finances for the rest of your life. Less earnings, harder to save for retirement,  and sluggish job market with more competiton for lower wages. 

Go talk to some millenials that were graduating from college in 2008. 

This..  isn't just about not liking biden. This is about giving yourself the best chance to succeed and start off on the best foot.***Obama should replace Ginsburg. He's studied constitutional law at an ivy league school. He's a class act, and spent most of his presidency trying his hardest to compromise with republicans.***>Whoever wins this election will fill the Supreme Court vacancy from Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She is tough as nails, but she is dying, and it’s very likely she’s not going to live for another 4 years. If Donald Trump wins re-election, he will fill that seat with a young, conservative jurist. It’s also likely Trump will fill at least one or two more seats on the Court as well. If that happens, it will cement a conservative majority.

And Biden won't? How fucking delusional are you that you can't look up his record on this issue?

Get out! And quit calling yourself a liberal!***I wonder how much of these people calling to vote third party are US voters, or even real people.***If enough people voted for 3rd party, wouldn't that get 3rd party elected?...or am I missing something? Hypothetically, if 200million people noped out of Biden and trump and voted for SpongeBob, wouldn't SpongeBob win?***I'm totally voting for Biden because I live in Florida where things can go either way, but people who live in California, for example, can safely vote for the Green Party knowing Biden will win the state anyways. Giving the Green Party a percentage of votes gives them more political power for future elections.***Are we really sure that many actual people are out there stumping for 3rd party protest votes right now? I just assume anyone spreading that kind of nonsense in 2020 is a Russian bot.***Great points, OP. I’m not thrilled with my liberal vote, this election, but I will vote Blue. I learned my lesson in 2016.***Who ever thought the constitution would have been such a threat to democracy? Other than James Madison at least.***And don’t forget the elimination of social security and Medicare.***I’m excited to vote for Joe Biden, but I absolutely detest Kamala Harris. She’s the Trump of the Democratic Party. I’m very depressed over this pick.***Yeah Biden enthusiastically voted for progressive justices like Sandra Day O’Conner and Antonio Scalia and protected Justice Clarence Thomas from sexual harassment allegations. He doesn’t exactly have a good record regarding the Supreme Court.

Who are the progressives that Biden has actually suggested he would nominate? We don’t even have a promise from him on this. Sorry, you aren’t selling Biden to me.***We spent this entire primary season saying to people that we wanted anyone but Biden. After South Carolina, we were basically told that thanks but we don’t need your vote. So I don’t understand why they expect it from us in Nov. they were more focused on attracting the middle of the road people and Republican lite folks. They alienated the largest voting block which would be the undecided. Add in that during this global reckoning of the disenfranchised minorities launched by the death of George Floyd. To nominate a former prosecutor in Harris has to be one of the most tone deaf things outside of Biden himself saying that if someone doesn’t vote for him, they’re not black. The party should have taken a hard look at itself after nominating Clinton in 2016 and didn’t. They’ve refused to move or grow as a party. I fully plan I’m voting in November just like I have in every other election, but I won’t be forced into choosing between those two evils. If the system is broken and I won’t allow my vote to be held hostage. So no I won’t suffer by eating oatmeal instead of a shit sandwich, if I don’t really like either.***I think you should vote for the candidate who you would most like to see in office, regardless of their party.

Voting third party to “punish” the Dems is childish. Voting third party because you actually like third party politics is mature.***Nothing gets people into the streets and fighting for change like disaster,  4 more years of trump will bring more change to america through revolt and revolution than the last 60 years of democratic party politics.  We got here through a 2 party state,  it's not changing with voting nor Joe Biden.  It will change if your willing to die to defend your right to an abortion or any other issue,  get in the street comrade the ballot box is closed it's time for the bullet.***Couldn't a third party vote also be seen as a vote for Biden from conservative perspective?***Our very lives depend on getting Trump out of the office, we can't afford to lose any votes, please vote Biden and get this sociopath out of the office!***Thank you for this! It is so important that we get Trump out, especially for the Supreme Court, but also all the other judges he’s been adding across smaller courts. This will affect us for years already! Whatever your complaints about Biden and Harris, they are miles better than what we have now and give me hope for our future.

We have a two party system and it won’t be any different this election. A vote for a third party is a vote for Trump.***Not to mention that the third parties literally do not deserve our votes. They had these past four years served to them on a silver platter, with a nation frustrated and screwed by a two party system needing real options, and what have they done to present themselves as the adults in the room? Freakin crickets.  
They know they aren’t going to be president, they’ve spent the last four years acting like they know they’re never gonna be president, so why should we give them our defeatist votes?  
Half the reason they even seem viable to people like that is simply those candidates haven’t been given nearly as many opportunities to disappoint the public as major party politicians have.***Suck it up and deal with Trump. He's not bad, not insane, not starting wars, and not putting people on SCOTUS that will kill you or destroy America, not racist, not any of those things people tell you he is. He was prosperity for all Americans and nothing he does will harm Americans in the pursuit of that. It may not be the system you like, but it's the system we have and changing it WILL harm Americans.

TDS has no basis in reality***A vote for Biden isn't a vote against Trump; it's a vote for the ruling class. Any attempt to be pragmatic is disingenuous. We need an actual leftwing party to be funded and not GOP-Lite. We are not the same. You're the same as the Republicans.***CGP grey made a point in one of his voting videos about why voting 3rd party is a bad idea. Tl;DW it takes from the party you can tolerate, and only empowers the opposite party. You'd need 1/3 of either party to make a dent anyway.***Hmmm***""Whoever wins this election will fill the Supreme Court vacancy from Ruth Bader Ginsburg""

This is more reason to vote for a republican and much more so a libertarian. I don't even think democrats should be allowed to sit in the supreme court. People who truly value the constitution should be arguing on its behalf.

""Any hope you have about Medicare for all, environmental protections,  voting rights for felons, all that will be lost.""

I haven't seen proof that medicare for all will decrease the sum of taxes and health insurance so until then, I can't say I'll be voting in favor of medical for all. How is the supreme court going to rule against environmental protection? I haven't thought about felons' voting rights so I don't know what to make of that.

""In addition, you better believe that gay marriage, Roe V. Wade, legalized weed and civil rights protections will be gutted.""

How do you know this is Trumps and McConnell's ""endgame""?***""In addition, you better believe that gay marriage, Roe V. Wade, legalized weed and civil rights protections will be gutted.""

No one is/will gut anything. That's crazy talk. Weed will probably not be legalized by any side. That doesn't stop the States though.

i8g9vx,"You’re not alone, I’m right there with you!  My coworkers are very openly conservative and bash liberals constantly.  I have become openly liberal in response and, of course, I’ve gotten tons of negative feedback and even complaints made against me.  Hypocritical, I know.

I definitely should’ve told him why he was wrong but I’m not confrontational***Get a new job asap. I'd like to get new neighbors but that is also difficult.***It was like that for me in the Las Vegas sports betting scene for 24 years. I was the only liberal among hundreds of regulars. Only vocal liberal anyway. A handful of others would come up to me and admit they were a Democrat, but didn't want anyone else to know. Overall it was an incredible array of white uneducated transplants from all over the country who were hateful and racist and didn't know a damn thing about politics other than they hated Democrats.

If anyone doubts how right wing and vile that sports betting community was, it spawned the likes of Wayne Allyn Root and Papa Joe Chevalier. Both of them were solely known as handicappers until they sensed their surroundings were so favorable to hate talk they switched there almost entirely. Well, Papa Joe in his later years was amusing because it was disguised as sports talk but all he did for 3 hours was rant that ""liberals stand for nothing.""

My favorite were the weekly betting lotteries during football season. We'd draw lots for order then often have to stand there for hours in line, waiting for the numbers to go up. This was primarily at Excalibur, MGM, Stardust and Hilton. Longest line by far was Excalibur since the sportsbook manager Sid Diamond really shaded the opening numbers based on his own opinion.

That line could be 150 deep. It was awesome during a presidential election year because we'd start talking politics and none of the right wingers knew a damn thing. But unlike today most of them basically conceded they didn't know a damn thing. It became like a tag team match because as soon as one right winger ran out of ammo while debating me he'd trade spots with some other guy in line so he could debate me.

My favorite period in those lotteries was early fall 1996 because they all despised Bill Clinton and had assumed for 4 years that he'd be one and done. But I had emphasized throughout that an incumbent whose party had been in power only one term very seldom loses. 

In 1992 those Las Vegas right wingers never believed that Bush would lose. They thought Republicans had an electoral lock on the White House. On election day itself I had debated several who were in total denial. One of them was Jay Kornegay, who was then at Imperial Palace but now a prominent sportsbook manager elsewhere in town. He is as right wing as it gets. 

But by mid October 1996 that group had gradually accepted the polling as accurate so it wasn't nearly as much fun the final few weeks.

Conservatives do love their phony wars. Remember the war on Christmas? Remember the “war on coal”? (Donald Trump promised to end that war, but in the third year of his presidency coal production fell to its lowest level since 1978, and the Department of Energy expects it to keep falling.)

Now, as the Trump campaign desperately searches for political avenues of attack, we’re hearing a lot about the “war on the suburbs.”

It’s probably not a line that will play well outside the G.O.P.’s hard-core base; Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t exactly come across as rabble-rousers who will lead raging antifa hordes as they pillage America’s subdivisions.

Yet it is true that a Biden-Harris administration would resume and probably expand on Obama-era efforts to finally make the Fair Housing Act of 1968 effective, seeking in particular to redress some of the injustices created by America’s ugly history of using political power to create and reinforce racial inequality.

For what Trump calls the “Suburban Lifestyle Dream” didn’t just happen; it was created by government policies. The great suburban housing boom that followed World War II was made possible by huge federal subsidies, via programs — especially the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration — that protected lenders from risk by insuring qualifying home mortgages. By 1950 the F.H.A. and the V.A. were insuring half of all mortgages nationwide.

Of course, these subsidies didn’t just help home buyers. They were also a gold mine for real estate developers, among them a guy named Fred Trump, who was later sued for discriminating against Black tenants, and whose son currently occupies the White House.

But these subsidies were only available to white people. In fact, they were only available in all-white communities. As Richard Rothstein reports in his 2017 book “The Color of Law,” F.H.A. guidelines specifically cautioned against loans in communities in which children might share classrooms with other children who “represent a far lower level of society or an incompatible racial element.”

Indeed, the F.H.A. went well beyond favoring all-white locations; it set out to create them. After the war, when developers like William Levitt began building new communities on what had been farmland, they cleared their plans in advance with the F.H.A., thereby guaranteeing that buyers would have automatic access to subsidized mortgages. And one of the things the F.H.A. required from such plans was strict racial segregation, supposedly to insure property values.

Now, all of this may sound like old history. But the raw racism of postwar housing policy cast a long shadow over our society. For the 20 or so years that followed World War II represented a unique opportunity for the middle class to solidify its position — an opportunity that was denied to Black people.

You see, the ’50s and ’60s were an era both of relatively good pay for ordinary workers and of relatively cheap suburban housing. Wages were fairly high, in part because America still had a strong union movement, and houses were affordable, as long as you had access to those federal housing programs. So millions of Americans got a chance to build some wealth.

Then the window of opportunity closed. Wages, adjusted for inflation, stagnated. Housing prices soared, in part because building restrictions in many suburbs banned multifamily units. And Black families, who were shut out of a rising market at a time when many other Americans were sharing in the fruits of a housing boom, found the financial barriers to homeownership especially daunting.

So Trump’s Suburban Lifestyle Dream is basically a walled village that the government built for whites, whose gates were slammed shut when others tried to enter.

What is Biden proposing to remedy at least some of these injustices? Reasonable, significant, but hardly revolutionary stuff — things like expanding rental vouchers while cracking down on redlining and exclusionary zoning. Trump may claim that such policies would “destroy suburbia,” but that only makes sense if you believe that the only alternative to bloody anarchy is a community that looks exactly like Levittown in 1955.

And it’s very important to understand that none of the scare talk about a war on the suburbs has anything to do with the usual conservative rhetoric about “freedom” and not having the government tell Americans what to do. Individual choices and free markets aren’t what made America such a segregated, unequal society. Discrimination was a statist policy, involving the exercise of political power to deny people free choice.

And it still goes on. What the Black Lives Matter movement has done is to reveal to many white Americans that we’re still a long way from being a society in which everyone is treated equally by the law, whatever the skin color. (Black Americans already knew that very well.)

But the big difference between the parties now is that Biden and Harris are trying to make things better, trying to make us more like the country we’re supposed to be.

The slow-down comes from eliminating local sorting hubs that can turn around local mail - like ballots - to local addresses - like Election Offices - overnight as opposed to sending it to a higher level hub, which adds at least a day.

The removed sorting machines are probably coming from offices no longer acting as local hubs, and are being sent to the next higher level to cover the added volume, or discarded.

Thus has been done in the past to cut expense, just like removing blue collection boxes which may require additional special collection routes.

ibm9fs,"The full text of the editorial is as follows:

---



Finishing a task that a Republican-controlled Congress gave it three years ago, the Trump administration has finalized plans for new oil and gas leases in one of the most pristine stretches of the world: the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

It’s a manifestly bad idea that Congress was wrong to slip into the 2017 budget bill, and in its rush to craft the new rules the administration has likely opened a door for legal challenges. But Congress should not defer to the courts on this — it must fix the problem it created.

Congress approved offering the leases — ending more than 35 years of protections — not in response to the will of the people but in defiance of public sentiment. Only 35% of Americans supported drilling in ANWR. About the only people supporting the notion are some oil- and gas-industry firms and their political supporters — mainly Alaska Republicans.

And Trump, whose retrograde enthusiasm for burning ever more fossil fuels endangers the health of the planet and its suitability for human habitation.

As The Times’ editorial board wrote last year, “proponents note that the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act designated a section known as the 1002 area as a site for future drilling should Congress approve it. But that’s a far cry from saying it must be open for drilling, and the balance of interests tilts decidedly toward leaving the region alone.”

Yet the Bureau of Land Management ruled that draft plans calling for constructing well pads, up to four airstrips, 175 miles of roads and a pipeline wouldn’t pose an undue threat to the more than 270 different species that live in the region, including polar bears and migrating caribou herds.

If there’s any good news here, it’s that current market forces weigh against the industry trying to sink new wells in such an expensive and inhospitable place, and that consumer pressure against such moves will be considerable. Even major banks are balking at financing such projects.

Plus, the environmentalists’ legal challenges may prove insurmountable.

David J. Hayes, a former Interior Department deputy secretary in the Clinton and Obama administrations, told the Washington Post the Trump administration’s environmental review centered on establishing the drill pads and did not consider the broader impacts from expanded drilling and pipeline operations, as the law requires.

“You can’t just take the first step of the program,” Hayes said. “I think that statutory language is a real tripwire for these guys.”

Given all that uncertainty, it wouldn’t be surprising to see oil and gas companies decline to bid on leases they may never get to exercise.

No one knows whether Trump’s toxicity might finally catch up with him in the November election and lead to a change in administrations — and perhaps a change in control of the Senate. If it does, Congress can undo several months’ worth of regulatory actions through the Congressional Review Act — just as it did in early 2017 to undo a number of late-term Obama regulatory changes.

But as I noted earlier, Congress created this problem, and it can fix it by withdrawing its permission to sell the leases in the first place. The nation, and the world, needs to move away from burning fossil fuels if we are to stand any chance of limiting damage from global warming, which (as we learned just last week) has likely pushed Greenland’s massive ice sheet past the tipping point, leading ultimately to its disappearance — and eventually adding 23 feet to current sea levels.

The government needs to pursue policies exactly opposite of those pushed by Trump. Which means we desperately need a change in government.",0,0,0,Neutral,Opinion: Trump's push to expand Arctic drilling is dangerous and foolhardy,reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/ibm9fs/opinion_trumps_push_to_expand_arctic_drilling_is/,8/17/2020,opinion trump 's push expand arctic drilling dangerous foolhardy

“Dear representatives;
Our postal service is dying and I believe I have a solution that wears at a vulnerable angle. 

I believe we need prompt legislation to fix the federal pension systems, and ensure proper benefit liability.

The USPS, as a reward for hiring a massive amount of veterans, also gets the pleasure of paying their entire pension.

This creates an insurmountable burden on USPS.

Paraphrasing Forbes on 8/17/2020, if a veteran spends 18 years in the military and two years in the USPS, USPS currently  must pay 100 percent of that veterans pension when it is due.

The idea of the USPS bearing 100 percent of responsibility for these pensions is absurd.
 I believe STRONGLY messaging this as a fraud or snafu can create a legal framework to protect our vulnerable populations, seniors and veterans from being harmed by right wing extremists and fascist doctrine. 
It can court public opinion and strengthen our ability to support effective agencies.
I encourage you to read the article from Forbes, titled ‘Postal Service Debt is in Part a Defense Department Subsidy...’, that examines the accounting snafu that is crippling our postal service.

Thank you for your leadership, 

Your constituent “

I've been looking at the math more closely, and particularly this link from Pew Research:

https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2020/08/18/a-resource-for-state-preelection-polling/

The fascinating table is near the bottom -- ""Voter's Education Distribution."" I always look for easy numerical reference points to evaluate a statewide trend. In that table was a bottom line that as of 2016 the United States average was 30% of voters at high school education or less, and 40% at college graduate. From logic, and via sampling the table, it stood out to me that a Democratic state would be below 30 in the first category and above 40 in the second category. A Republican state would be reversed, and specifically where the first number is higher than the second number. Then the swing states are in the middle, very close to that 30/40 ratio.

There was good news/bad news all over the place. The good news is that the high school or lower number drops every 4 years while the college graduate number typically rises every 4 years. That plays to blue advantage.

Some states in particular are evolving rapidly in our favor. Everything about Arizona is confirmed:

2004: 34% high school, 32% college graduate

2008: 28% high school, 36% college graduate

2012: 26% high school, 37% college graduate

2016: 23% high school, 40% college graduate

That should be an emerging blue state, given it is well below the national percentage of high school educated while even with the national percentage of college graduates. I would say Democrats were late to the game to prioritize Arizona.

Texas was also promising at 27/41.

It's amazing how similar the other swing states are:

Michigan: 30/38

Pennsylvania: 35/36

Wisconsin: 31/37

Florida: 31/36

North Carolina: 29/38

Georgia: 33/36

Iowa: 30/35

However, Ohio seems like a waste of time at 37/34***Although many feel that is good, there may be some bad side effects from not having a strong enough counterpoint when deciding what to do.

If you are held within a court case, and you feel there is bias in the courtroom, you can report it. If you do not agree with the judges decision, you can go to the next level of court stature. Also, democratic leaders have pushed for the decriminalization of marijuana. I have no opinion or knowledge on the actual deprisonment of inmates. 

Countless democratic leaders have openly pushed for open borders. Seeking asylum is not seeking refuge from another country for non-war related circumstances. Also, we are not the world's piggy bank. We have the united nations to address these types of matters.

Guns do not commit mass shootings, people do, specifically those with mental illness. There is currently over 20,000 gun laws on the books, and 300 federal laws on the books.

I do not know one person who feels that christianity is being opposed on besides bible fanatics protesting on campuses to create lawsuits. However, that does not mean it doesnt exist.

Healthcare and Education is expensive because of centralized policies and centralized subsidies by the government by which created insurance monopolies. As a consequence, prices rise since doctors do not have multiple options creating competition, known as capitalism, not corporatism.

As a whole, the left is more anti-Semitic than you give credit for. Additionally, if you are on the left, you are conditioned to believe that an evangelist Christian’s opinion is founded in lunacy and therefore should be disregarded.

I had a great friend tell that Trump is the best president in history and we literally have not talked since. I would hate to end over that, but how can someone be that stupid? I understand not want Hillary, or even Biden, but to say Trump is sufficient, let alone ""great"", is fucking asinine. How out of touch with reality can you be? He is a terrible president, regardless of what side you vote on.***I live in a complete red zone. I'm the only one I know that doesn't worship Trump. It can be a bit much to process at times....so I feel your pain.***And another friends only stance is trump is pro life. But would vote for another candidate if they were against abortion. Fuck there are so many other issues that affect so many lives. Not just the unborn. And she doesn’t want to hear them.

Some Trumpers are just never gonna vote dem and that is ok, but it's not ok if they continue to let Trump get what he wants, so just have them sit out if you can***“Profoundly sad”?

Has been since the 80's.***With the blatant attack on the usps to cheat election results, maybe the fact that he doesn’t even respect democracy or the entire family defrauding a cancer charity are ways to reach her?

These are two that I simply can’t understand not being reviled by.***What I would do: select 3 things from this mega-list that you think she would be outraged by most. Then ask her thoughts on them. https://remember45.com/list-all/***So many of my coworkers love him. Some how they think me not talking and quietly leaving the room means I agree. I got 8 moths left.

Fuck! What planet do they live on.***Wow, I see a lot of hate and hyperbole in this thread. There is a reason we have almost half the country supporting Republicans. It's not because they are idiots or that they are mindless maga robots.

I will be voting for Biden in November. My SO, my parents, and my SO's mom are all voting for Trump. I have been getting a steady flood of MAGA propaganda from my SO's mom for the last 2 months. I still love all of these people, we just happen to disagree about who should be president.

If it gets to the point where you feel like you are mourning the death of your parents because they are voting for someone you don't like, then it may be time to step away from the news for a little while and spend some time with your family.***Join the club, homie.***I suggest a really big Turkey dinner the day before the election so they may just sleep through it.

No matter who wins, Biden or Trump, USA will be irrelevant in 10 years, which is a good thing.***I wish I had time. I would start an organization help you and people in your position. Imagine if it were possible for her to receive a lot of letters that the outside is handwritten to make it more likely that they are opened. The inside would have quotes from Trump about lying, sexual harassment, troops being losers, etc. 

Then you could purchase letters to be sent to her for the cost of the mailing and materials.***You should ask her genuinly about why she voted. She must have reasons, and even if you can't make it out about politics with her (not necessarily making her submit, maybe you should instead?) just follow the republican catchphrase ""don't bring up politics with friends and family"".***Please don't let the craziness that our politics has become ruin your relationship with your mother. Believe your own assessments of who the people you know are, not what people who have no investment in your life tell you about the implications of their politics***It's not her fault, not entirely at least. I'm guessing she's older, yes? White? Suburban? Protesant? Middle class? Living in a flyover state? Its just tribalism at that point. A lot of Trump supporters vote for him simply because its whats socially expected of them. A lot of them vote for him because he told them he's the only one who cares about and protects their way of life. Don't take it too hard. The older generation will gradually die off and their belief system along with it. I hate to be so pragmatic about it, but sadly it's the truth.***It is not you in the voting booth, it is her***My mom and your mom sound exactly the same. This literally just happened to me today. I have no advice I'm just devastated. I feel ya***You should be. Your mom supports a monster, that makes her a horrible person, and now you’re wondering what that makes you, the child of a horrible person. Your reaction is perfectly normal and valid. Just realize you are not your parents but a distinct person with your own moral code and values.***The most important people in my life this year are the same. It makes me feel hopeless. It’s incredibly painful and I’m so sorry you are going through the disappointment.***Ugh I feel it. Both my parents are trumpers. It is truly disheartening***There are a lot of people that are kind of coy about voting for Trump, but don't buy it. They are nearly all Trump supporters. They don't like Libs, minorities or maybe they just like someone that is authoritarian etc., but that's why its so important for Biden supporters to show up and vote. 

You'll note people like your mom also will not abstain or vote for 3rd parties. Doing either would demonstrate you really don't like Trump but that's not what they are doing. They are knowingly voting for a racist, lying charlatan that has hurt the country immensely. That is unethical imo.***She allowed to have her own opinions?***She’s just dumb. I’m sorry that she thinks her stupidity is relevant and needs to be inflicted upon others with an immature irresponsible vote. Fuck your mom and every stupid motherfucker like her.***Sorry but your mom’s a bitch***What is her most watched television channel?***Have you talked to her?***Is she single?***Listen to your mother explain why, she might actually have reasons you can't fathom due to your inexperience in life.***The problem with parental units voting for trump is that it is harder to cut them out of your life than other relatives, cousins, for example.  People have stronger ties with their parents, and also, cutting them out of your life might muck up a possible inheritance.***Which state?***Don't let politics ruin your relationship with you family. That's even more sad.***Same.  My mom was never political before.  Covid got her on her phone more actively.  We've talked politics.  I'm very well researched, and my mom isn't an extremist by any means, but all of my facts and appeals to ethics can't match her Facebook feed.  I'm so bothered that her uninformed vote with neutralize my vote that comes from a place of research.***My moms full blown Trump cult and I don’t hesitate to tell her. Sometimes people don’t know they are stupid until it’s pointed out even our parents.***I actually feel the same as your mom. I identify as socially liberal, fiscally conservative.

inrqtk,"The direction that points to people who care about others. The polar opposite of the direction of conservatives.***An excellent question.  It changes with time and people and the present political situation. 

Liberal, in broad terms, is simply a generosity of human and political spirit that allows all people to attain the highest level of existence.

Some would say that a liberal is a person who does not understand the harshness and complexity of life and would give away the store so everyone can feel good. Not a good thing

Politically, liberal is far more complex.  The labor movement has always been considered liberal, and those who opposed it, conservative.

When it comes to money, Republicans have always complained that liberal Demorats only want to tax and spend.  Personally, I've never seen what's wrong with that, within reason. But, then, I'm a liberal.

Today, because of the upcoming election, people will have to decide if they favor Trump or Biden.  That lumps all the different kinds of liberals together.  

The most important thing is that America is a revolutionary government.  We revolted from England because they were a monarchy and we were not.  We wanted the people to rule, not a king who got his/her authority from god.  So, I guess a true liberal is someone who believes that the people should rule the people, like our government was set up to do.

iskasc,"> Systemic Racism

Saved you a click***I wish I had a way to get this in to the hands of all the cops I know without being super obvious as to my intent. 

My wife (who is Mexican and Black) wanted to get a gun for protection. I (being a terrified white person) didn’t want her to because of, you know, racism. Our cop friend said she had nothing to worry about and she should get the gun for protection. When I pointed out that it’s not that simple for black people, the cop argued that there are NO RACIST COPS in existence so as long as she identified that she had a gun and followed all orders, there would be no problems. 

So is it naïveté or a gut reaction to protect your brothers in blue? Because that’s not reality.

I’ll be the first to admit that my reaction of being automatically concerned about her having a gun isn’t ok - but I want my wife to be safe and don’t want to give any reason for her being in danger.***Why I did I immediately see the meme of the dude looking for the scroll of truth, seeing the truth and then throwing it away in disgust?***>The researchers also couldn’t figure out why Black people are always initially charged with more serious crimes than white people. The easiest explanation was that Black suspects commit worse crimes than white people, but the data disproved that assumption. Then, they hypothesized that prosecutors may be overzealous when it came to convicting violent cases but that proved not to be the case. When all was said and done, Black people were arrested more often, had higher bail and received harsher sentences

There is actually a really simple answer to this that is always ignored. Since american blacks typically live in lower socio-economic conditions, they often cannot afford a proper lawyer or legal representative to defend their cases. Typically they'll end up having a lawyer appointed to them, which is obviously not going to weild as efficient outcomes. Hence the harsher sentencing due to not being able to afford a proper representative for their case.***So... It's not poverty leading to an increase in criminal acts?***Systemic Racism. Saved you the click if you didn’t guess.***Speaking to the poster who said his wife wanted to get a gun, the first thing I would do if I were you is cut off all ties to this so-called police officer because if he has in his mind that there are no racist cops then he's just another cop that hides behind that blue line(he might be a racist and you just don't know it) because unfortunately there are racist cops there are racist white cops there are racist black cops there are racist Hispanic cops and more. Unfortunately there are a lot of racist walking amongst the general public but for the most part I believe there are more good officers than bad and we need the police to keep crime down but we don't need the dirty cops that are doing what they're doing to these people on the streets these protesters or George Floyd or anything like that those cops need to be arrested and charged. And take it from me these federal laws for the most part are so biased against certain groups this I know for a fact and they need to be changed especially the federal laws on marijuana and this coming from someone that does not partake in a good smelling crippy bud party lol to all my liberal friends out there if you are on the fence about voting for Joe Biden please come and vote for Joe Biden because my liberal friends you will get some of the things you want with a Joe Biden administration and rightfully so, but in this wannabe dictators administration you and I and all others that despise him will continue to get nothing but shit on. You all stay safe and vote. 😷☑️🌊***This is more confirmation of the existence of white privilege. If a white person is arrested for the same crime as a black person they will likely face substantially less penalties.***I couldn't find a link to the actual study***Huh, I would have sworn it was committing crime***Solid article. I’m pretty close with a lot of LEOs and am generally very supportive of law enforcement. I think this article shows it’s not as simple as “cops are racist” which is spewed regularly on cable news and social media. The issue is more complex and deeply rooted in all the systems of justice. It’s a compounding of more stops of blacks by police, more arrests and more charges and higher charges brought against blacks from police and prosecutors, a jury, judge, sentencing system that also has inherent biases. 

Not sure how you fix all this- I don’t think it’s “defunding” the police (edit: I think using this study and data to drive better training, and guidelines and rules of engagement for police would be better- which means more funding). I think some other good first steps would be using data like this to drive sentencing and charging recommendations rather than just how the prosecutor/judge is feeling about that particular individual.***Duh.***",0.0975,0.300591485,0.548262241,Positive,A Judge Asked Harvard to Find Out Why So Many Black People Were In Prison.

With that said, especially since Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump haven’t even waited for her body to grow cold before hypocritically plotting her replacement, Biden as President and a Democratic Senate need to move immediately on four things after their inaugurations:

1.  The Senate needs to expand the Supreme Court to 13 Justices.

2.  Biden needs to get 4 picks for those seats.

3.  After that, we need an Amendment to the US Constitution that it then takes 2/3 of the Senate to approve a Supreme Court Justice nominee and to expand [EDIT: or contract] the seats on the Court in the future.

Duty.

So I blame everyone, a Conservative justice that immediately retired when Trump won, those that didn't retire when Obama was in office, the electoral college that for all intents and purposes trashed the Presidential vote of 2,868,686 American Citizens etc (the margin HRC won the popular vote). 

The latter is appalling, the electoral college negated 2.1% of the **total** popular vote. I mean that is insane, crazy. 

Usually winning an election by 2% is considered a healthy margin, not even requiring a recount in most places.

VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHAT***Unpopular opinion (and I voted for Kerry and Hilary), but it's not liberals responsibility to vote for whoever Democrats put up when the Democrats historically offer very little to the left. It's the Democrats responsibility to offer more to that segment of the party to earn their votes. And you're the asshole for this post, not them.***LOL. I voted for Hillary, but being upset that people couldn't vote for that vile woman isn't productive nor is it going to win you anything other than a pat on the back from people who will willingly vote for any democrat as long as they're a democrat. 

Newsflash: Trump was elected after 8 years of Obama in which virtually NOTHING progressive was done. Not 1 fucking thing. Medicare for all? No. Student loan forgiveness? No. Throwing the schmucks that caused the financial crisis into prison due to absolute unadulterated greed? No. Legalizing Marijuana? No. This was also partially during a time when they had a SUPER MAJORITY.

I could go on and on, but the blame of this situation lies solely on the democratic bigwigs who thought it was a foregone conclusion that Hillary would win while Obama and the democrats sat on their hands for a YEAR because they never imagined this could happen. You blame people for being sick of the same bs, that nothing of significant substance changes when you elect someone who promises what Obama seemingly exemplified: Change.

The fact that you think it's ""liberals"" on the left who refused to vote for clinton on principle is telling.***Name calling isn’t going to help us win the election in November. As hard as it can be, try to be positive. Make bridges, don’t burn them.
Let’s look forward, not backwards.******politics isn't a 'big game' and then it's over... winner take all style.

it's a continuum and plays out over a long timeline with the pendulum swinging back and forth ... so, let's rewind and see what the chess match would have brought if hillary did win. (i certainly wish it was the case)

1. the house probably wouldn't have flipped. americans tend to award seats in congress to the opposite party of the sitting president. hillary was a remarkably unpopular democrat, so it's even more likely.

2. senate would still be in the GOP's hands and no one she nominated or nominates would be or would have been confirmed. period.

3. very good chance she would have been a one term president ... and been as divisive of a figure as trump. he'll also be a one-termer.

4. ginsburg would have died with ~40 days left in her presidency, with a GOP controlled senate who has a serious shot at winning the presidency. NO WAY anyone left of kavanaugh gets approved.

5. republicans potentially control house, senate, presidency, and supreme court after nov 2020.

but, as it stands, dems control the house, will likely win the presidency, could gain the senate and at a minimum replace ginburg with a civil rights hero like her... maintaining status quo and maybe even get another nomination.

lastly, i live in a completely red state.. i voted third party because i despise the two-party system... and my hillary vote wouldn't matter a bit... unlike the critical obama voters in the midwest that stayed home.

i'm sure you don't mean this post to be as angry and divisive as it seems, but rather than blaming people with strong views that might find some of hillary's beliefs and deeds objectionable, how about being pissed off that relatively few people are benefitting from a two party system that serves itself first?

The problem is that the differences are kinda big points in some cases.

And in order to be meaningful, it also needs to be civil. How can we achieve that?***I completely agree. We are a center left nation which ignores or puts down center left people.***I disagree.  The two-party system in America has created a false spectrum of conservatism and liberalism, and what's commonly thought to be moderate is hardly that.

I'll concede on your point that politicians and citizens should be more willing to compromise because no one solution will ever be perfect for everyone, but those who want to remain in power have erroneously politicized so much: BLM, women's right to choose, gay marriage, the wealth gap, ICE, military dominance, climate change...the list goes on and on.  And there's a false equivalence that you're making in your post, and that's saying that there *are* two valid perspectives to the stories we see.  **But there's no compromise for the notion that Black lives do matter.  There's no compromise for the notion that women should have autonomy over their own bodies.**  There are no other valid perspectives on this -- there just aren't.  These topics are ""sensationalist"" because we're literally losing lives as we try to debate them.  In the current sociopolitical climate in America, moderate policies can't do anything to fundamentally fix things that have been broken for a long, long time.

And one more thing: healing the country is far from enough.  I assume you mean ""going back to the way things were,"" which means a government founded on insidiously systemic racism, misogyny, and scapegoating.  We have centuries of recompense to make up for, and returning to that level of ""normalcy"" would be a failure.***Moderate politics don't really exist nowadays.

izb1eg,"I don’t think he’ll have to ‘eek out’ a win. I think it’s going to be closer than most of us are ready to accept. This election is about the culture war going on and the ‘other’ culture is just as big as ours, are already mobilized voters (unlike a few of our sub-groups but we’re working on it), and on principle wouldn’t vote for a democrat. There is no real ‘center’ for us to pull people leftwards from. If they were cool with Trump through all the things Trump said and did even before they elected him the first time what makes anyone think they’d be less cool with him now. Especially after he has legitimately accomplished some of the spoken and unspoken goals of the right wing as far as limiting immigration, nominating hundreds of conservative federal
Judges, helping remake the Supreme Court, making promises to undo equal equal marriage rights and abortion rights, and reforming the tax code to favor the wealthy. There isn’t really anything for a republican to not actually love besides his actually personality.

We’re fooling ourselves if we think the people who bought into the ‘Obama is from Kenya’ stuff and we’re super concerned about their guns being taken away are going to vote for the same president’s Vice President.

I think there is hope we can win. But I think it will be close. I know several deep south republicans who are far more vocal in support of him than they were even in 2016 because they see him as a champion of their rights (don’t ask, it doesn’t make sense. All I can say is the south is very chock full of really stupid and gross people. More so than anywhere else I’ve been).***Ok***I think sheer laziness got in the way as well.  Would have cut in on golf and ""Executive Time"" (watching Fox and tweeting for hours per day).***You're naive if you think that's what would have happened. 

I'll take some liberty extrapolating from a different country, Israel, where a different, autocratic leaning and corrupt leader, Bibi, actually decided to listen to the experts and close the country as soon as possible and impose a strict lockdown. The result? A disinformation campaign by the media the likes of which were never seen. The left (and center) leaning mainstream media here turned into Breitbart levels of COVID denial. None-stop flood of COVID dismissing, constant blabbering about how ""it didn't turn as bad as they predicted"", ""the dictator locking us in home"", ""the economy is ruined"", ""we must learn to live with coronavirus"".

If you think Republican COVID denial is ridiculous, at least you have the media and everyone brainwashing the people back in the correct direction, which leads to less reckless actions and some resistance to reckless coronavirus actions. 

Here's what would happen in that alternative world where Trump would have chosen the correct option, like Bibi, and reacted strongly. The media wouldn't praise his economic sacrifice for saving lives. Instead, I guaranty you that the media would just automatically pick the opposite side, and you would have been brainwashed about all the economic damage, about how Trump overreacted, and about how COVID only kills old people. 

And believe me, even more people would have died then, when mainstream media is brainwashing everyone into non-compliance and neglect, because they have far more power over people's actions than Trump or Bibi. Israel is the only country dealing with insane surge in cases, and I'm certain that the automatic opposite-side taking by the media, fueled by extreme (justified) disgust to the autocratic leaning right leader, had a big role to play here. The entire country was brainwashed to backtrack and make a U turn on a successful policy right on the finish line by corrupt media.

The real responsibility is on the media for politicizing the issue and taking sides. It seems like the drivers of nearly all media are political entities judging every report and every action as a positive or negative for a political side, and the reporting and facts presented are automatically chosen to correspond with the actions of the political side which they align with.

It's almost a reversion of cause and effect. Instead of honest and truthful reporting leading to smart and informed actions by leaders, it's reversed - the actions are chosen arbitrarily by the leaders, and only then the media reports it in a biased way according to which side did the action, and not the merits of the action. 

I am also pretty sure you would have had a very different view of what is the correct action in that alternate world where Trump do what you are suggesting, because the media you watch would have brainwashed you into the opposite direction by definition. I've seen how spineless and lacking critical judgement the dumb masses are in Israel.

That being said, things have been far more chaotic and institutionally questionable in the past. Admittedly this was mostly pre-FDR/pre-modern era. Still, until the new deal, the US was a ricketty-ass minecart, and any single event with bad timing could have potentially knocked the whole project apart. I think that from after the civil war until at least WWI the country was as vulnerable as ever in terms of collapse/dissolution, or even perhaps civil war as ever, and DEFINITELY much more so than today. The only eras that could have led to dissolution were the very early republic and the Federalist/Jeffersonian tensions and then the residual tensions until at least Jackson or even up to civil war.

He is not popular among a majority of Americans and never has been. If he won the popular vote, I would be extremely skeptical. Especially if there was controversy about how votes were counted and voter suppression efforts (which his cronies are already openly engaged in). He's proven time and again that he cannot be trusted. He and his enablers constantly lie to such depth and magnitude that it has eroded any trust in his administration. The only way I would accept it was if everything ran smoothly, no controversy about votes being thrown out, no voter suppression, etc.- and that seems very unlikely given his rhetoric.***I view it as not everyone voted.

If it’s because of low voter turnout or something, I’ll be furious at my side, but I’ll still accept it. 

Where I tend to draw the line is if he wins on some sort of underhanded technicality that, while legal, undermines the sentiment of the elections. For example, appointing a third conservative justice against the precedent the GOP set in 2016, and then relying on SCOTUS to invalidate results so that he wins. While it’s not illegal, it completely undermines the integrity and sentiment of our elections.

izvjx5,"Looks like nobody is offering an actual answer.

I personally agree. It's an opinion. An ignorant, stupid, wrong one but still an opinion.

I think people who argue that it isn't are trying to argue something like how you're not allowed to have an opinion on the color of the sky. It is blue. It is not up for debate. It is, factually, blue. End of discussion. If you say otherwise, it's not an opinion. It's an outright ignoring of fact.

So for people who say being racist is not an opinion I believe they are saying it is factually wrong because genetically we're all the same species with very minor differences in physical characteristics only. Their argument is likely that the pigment coloring ones skin is as relevant as their eye color and nobody's ever been eye-color-ist because it's stupid and unfounded, same as skin-color-ist.

They're likely implying the studies which have shown that it's not the color of ones skin which explains the socioeconomic differences between races. It's opportunity, perpetuating poverty, etc. Racism causes inequality and then people use that inequality to justify racism.

So when they say that I think that's what they're getting at? It's not an opinion because there is decided science that says what is factual or not, and ones skin color alone is factually irrelevant?

Same for homosexuality, I imagine. Except it's a little harder to explain because homosexuals are taking an overt action to have sex with someone of their own gender, not just existing like with differing races. That's fine, of course, but I've heard that line of thinking used by religious bigots to explain why they embrace the Bibles bigotry but not things like its pro-slavery. All of that is to say, homosexuals are no better or worse as people because they're the same species as the rest of us. It's like looking at a blue jay and arbitrary deciding a section of the population is different even though they're all still blue jays.

Again.... Not my personal view on the matter but it's something I've seen proposed by people who think it's not an opinion.***Racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another, and that one can make broad assumptions based on that belief. I do not have to tolerate any such beliefs from anyone. This is in no way comparable to personal preferences like “pineapple dose not belong on pizza”***I don’t think you’re confused. I think this is a shitpost.***I think you're taking someone's impassioned dislike for racism too literally.

Opinions are thoughts, thoughts can be total shit.

It gets tricky because calling it an opinion recalls that belief: ""Everyone's entitled to their opinion.""

Some people might think calling it an opinion somehow validates it, which it does not.

Some ideas are bad. Racism is one of them.***Wow. What an idiot.***Its not an opinion because liking  pineapple on pizza can be different to people, some can like it some dont but racism, belief that one race is superior to another is factually incorrect, same with homophobia, biology and science all can confirm that being gay is a natural human trait, so saying gays shouldnt exist or its wrong is factually incorrect***its not illegal to be a racist shitbag. if someone wants to be a racist shitbag, let them. they have the right to believe whatever stupid ass shit they want. they have their rights too. however, if it harms anyone in any way, it is no longer allowed. if they start something, deny someone a job, or god forbid actually hurt someone. it is not okay. their right to swing their arm ends at my face.

thats what the constitution promises.

izweu0,"***I don’t consider any of the policies mentioned to be “fighting dirty”.***6 years ago...***The Left needs to stop purity-testing itself and its potential allies. That's Job One.

Only *then* it can start playing some hardball.***If Biden wins and Dems take the Senate, Congress could easily pass a law saying the Supreme Court can only take cases in which 7 or more justices agree to take the case.  Most Supreme Court decisions result in that kind of lopsided result, maybe we should limit them to only making those kinds of consensus decisions.***Agreed. We have to convince them to fight tougher (not sure that I'd call it fighting ""dirty"" though). No point in following nonsense rules that Republicans ignore. Seize every opportunity to help Americans, end corruption, and make the system more democratic. That includes court packing and adding states. The hell with conservative tantrums and double standards.***We do have a vested interest in preserving the integrity of institutions and encouraging stable gradual sustainable changes and reforms.  However, the Republicans can't play dirty the way they have been as often as they have been while we Democrats play it as if our opponents are the more responsible Republicans of yore, because it means that we'll be screwed when we have, for example, a Democratic President trying to appoint a moderate older compromise justice (Garland was literally mentioned by name by Senator Hatch, the Republican judiciary chair at the time, as someone Obama would never pick but who he'd have to hold hearings for, so Obama picked him, and Hatch still didn't hold the hearings) 10 months before an election in 2016 and being blocked and then we'll have, just four years later, a Republican President trying to appoint a radical young right-wing extremist only a month before an election, during an election, really, since votes are already being cast, and not getting our own people in except when there is a perfect storm. The Republicans are having it both ways and governing like mafia bosses, and it means that they will be exercising the real power even when they are voted out if Democrats don't seize the moment.

If I were Joe Biden, after speaking with Schumer and Pelosi and getting everyone on the same page, I would have placed calls to both Mitch McConnell and Lindsay Graham and said, essentially ""Listen, this is your last chance to do this the right way. If you stick to your 2016 rule and don't give this nominee a hearing or a vote, I will keep 9 justices on the Supreme Court during my term.  You know I'm a person of my word and I keep my promises. However, if you jam someone through and I win and have a working majority in the Senate of at least 53, we are going to court pack to 12 justices, kill the filibuster completely, and admit Puerto Rico and Washington DC as states with two Senators each in my first 100 days in office.  It's your choice, but there is no going back if you do this."".

Why give the Republicans a chance to back down at all?  Because politicization of the judiciary is often considered an early indicator of a failing democracy. If Republicans will back down now, we might be able to salvage the judiciary that was once one of the finest most independent judiciaries in the world. However, if the Republicans go forward, it's over, the politicization will be irreversible without a constitutional amendment, and we will need to come out in January and be political about it because the one thing worse than a judiciary that is politicized by both parties, is a judiciary that is only politicized by one party that isn't our party.  If the Republicans keep acting the way they are acting, and Democrats pretend it's still the late 20th century, then Republicans will rule the courts and the country forever- the only way to have an independent judiciary is if both parties commit to it. Otherwise, it's the Republican judiciary with a few regular non-partisan justices and judges tossed in there, too, here and there.  The Republicans in the Senate and even many of the people they appoint do not respect the idea of an independent judiciary, our American government's institutional traditions and standards, or the rule of law.

The sheer hypocrisy of people like McConnell and Graham is so blatant and boundless that it reaches a level of depravity and disregard for the common good that really has no parallel. There are logical consequences to that.

I look at it like this, the first element of the filibuster was eliminated when Republicans started filibustering every single Obama nominee for every single vacancy to every single court, no matter how low the position.  We had courts that were hugely backlogged and had trouble hearing cases because vacancies weren't being filled. At one point, Obama nominated a Bush 43 administration lawyer just because a lower court needed a judge that badly and he was trying to be responsible and get them a judge somehow.  Republicans filibustered her, too. So, Harry Reid and the Democrats eliminated the filibuster on those type of appointments. Is that Harry Reid's fault? Of course not, it's Mitch McConnell's fault. He forced Reid's hand.

Likewise, the games the Republicans played in 2016 and are playing again right now in regard to the nation's highest court should basically force our hand when it comes to court packing. It's constitutional to do it if we have the votes, it's just not something that is generally advisable or good for the system under normal conditions. The Republicans are forcing our hands again, though, and if we pretend like that isn't going on, we will lose the Affordable Care Act and we will lose crucial protections for voters, minorities, and peaceful protesters. The Republicans are burning down the system, basically.

Here's a scary very plausible scenario. Trump will declare himself the winner on election night based on votes cast that day. However, if all the votes were to be counted, including mailed in ballots postmarked by that day, Biden would win- and many of those ballots will be counted after election day. 

So, there'll be legal and political battles. Both sides have hundreds of lawyers ready for this in key swing states.  Polling is showing that 2/3rd of the mail-in vote is Democratic, so Trump is trying to de-legitimize those votes, and Democrats will try to fight to ensure that every vote is counted.

Eventually, it's very likely that several of these issues will wind up before the Supreme Court.  The last, and (as best I can recall only) time that happened was in 2000, when the court ruled 5-4 in a case called ""Bush vs Gore"" to allow the Florida Secretary of State (A Republican) to stop a recount in Florida that would have likely allowed Gore, who was the undisputed winner of the national popular vote, to also win the state of Florida's electoral vote and thereby the entire electoral college, and become President.

Gore conceded defeat because, though he probably was the one who got the most votes in the state on which the electoral college swung that year, the Supreme Court was still at that time widely considered legitimate and Gore realized if he kept going after that, there was no way to really get a consensus on who the President was other than seeing who's orders the military listened to. He conceded an election he won for the good of the country. There is some very poignant footage of Gore, in his constitutional role as President of the Senate (He was Vice-President of the US at the time, and the national VP is President of the Senate) accepting the report of the electoral college that they had elected Bush, and repeatedly ruling objections from his fellow Democrats out of order and banging his gavel.

However, the thing there is that the Supreme Court was still considered legitimate. Right now, Neil Gorsuch is sitting in Merrick Garland's seat.  By the time this post election day stuff is litigated, there may be another extreme right-wing Trump appointee sitting where a Democratic appointee should be. So, Biden can't concede after a 5-4 ruling in favor of Trump. He also can't concede after a 6-3 ruling in favor of Trump. Maybe if it gets to 7-2, he can concede.

That's the mess the Republicans have created. They're going to have to live with it. They have destroyed (Or likely will have destroyed if they push another Trump appointment through) the credibility of the very institution they probably need to have be respected as a final arbitrator in the upcoming election, and maybe not just for this this fall, but maybe for years or decades or forever.

The Republicans are destroying all of the higher ideals this country is supposed to stand for. And they don't care, because they only believe in those principles when it convenient for them to do so. They'd be happy enough living in an authoritarian dictatorship as long as it banned abortions and gave the rich more tax cuts.

I think Biden would like to respect the system, but the Republicans have backed him into a corner where his own base isn't going to let him do it.  If he tries, the response from his base is going to be ""Fine, we'll keep fighting and if you don't want to be President, you can resign January 20th, and Harris will be President. If she doesn't want to do it either, she can resign also, and Pelosi will be President (The Speaker of the House is third in line for the Presidency)."".

Trump, Moscow Mitch, and the Republican Party are playing a game that seems destined to either end in an illegitimate Trump second term and an increasingly authoritarian less free America, or a Biden first term where major changes will have to be made to save our democracy. What the Republicans are doing is self-destructive.

The truth is, in the last 20 years, Democratic Presidential candidates have won the most votes (aka the popular vote) in 4 out of 5 elections.  Yet, only one Democrat was recognized as winning the electoral college and actually became President.  Obama won twice, so the American people's choice only actually made it into office 2 out of 5 times.

Similarly, the House is so gerrymandered that in 2012, a majority of Americans voted for Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives, and it somehow resulted in a large Republican majority in the House of Representatives. The Senate is sort of naturally gerrymandered, guaranteed to give states with five people and a herd of cattle the same 2 Senators a state like California with a bunch of huge cities and most of our Pacific coast gets.

Even with those rules, the written ones and the unwritten ones, Republicans still feel compelled to lie and cheat. What they are doing has the effect of weakening the rules in general.  When they do that, it seems logical to assume that Democrats will feel obliged to also stretch the rules just to try to break even, or make new rules that favor the Republicans less.*****""The Left needs to take a page from conservatives & start fighting dirty!""**

j49dku,"Oh, dear.............so anyways....***The text of the op-ed follows:

---

When President Trump introduced Amy Coney Barrett last Saturday as his nominee to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat, Republican luminaries sat close together at the Rose Garden event. With only a few wearing masks, they cheered Barrett’s nomination, then chatted among themselves afterward — even exchanging handshakes and hugs.

Two people from the event have now tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Which raises a question: Has Trump’s reckless approach to the disease threatened to infect the GOP Senate caucus, putting Republican senators in danger as well? If so, what would that mean for the whole Senate, and for Barrett’s confirmation hearing?

The White House just announced that Trump is being taken to Walter Reed, out of an “abundance of caution.” Earlier, the White House said he has “mild symptoms” and his campaign postponed upcoming events.

Now other parts of the government appear under threat.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) announced Friday that he had tested positive for coronavirus. He was in the Rose Garden last Saturday: In video of the event, he is seen hugging two people who appear to be old friends.

The Rev. John I. Jenkins, the president of the University of Notre Dame, where Barrett teaches, was at the event as well, not wearing a mask. He has also tested positive.

Others present included Attorney General William P. Barr and White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, and Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) — who, unlike most guests, wore a mask, but left it exposing his nose.

Here’s video:

Still, all this comes after Trump and his crew may have placed people at risk during the debate. The only people who were supposed to go unmasked were Trump, Joe Biden and moderator Chris Wallace. But once there, nearly the entire Trump entourage, including family members and staff, removed their masks.

The Saturday gathering appears even worse, though to be clear, we don’t yet know whether it actually was a superspreader event.

“Given the number of people at that event who tested positive in subsequent days, it’s certainly possible,” Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, told us. But he said we must be “cautious about drawing any conclusions until there’s been a proper investigation.”

Konyndyk noted that the event was outdoors, which “would have mitigated the risk somewhat.” At the same time, he said, “people were chatting in close proximity for quite a long time,” and this was a “mass gathering event where you know people were not following some of the basic prevention protocols.”

This “mass gathering event,” however, involved the president of the United States and a handful of top advisers, a would-be Supreme Court justice and numerous members of the party that controls the U.S. Senate.

Which raises serious implications for how GOP senators should now proceed. The Post’s Robert Costa reports that some Republicans may ask Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to “take the Senate out of session next week.” One aide told Costa: “If some in the Republican caucus get sick, we are screwed.""

This, combined with the news of Trump testing positive, means the Senate might have to put in place much stricter testing protocols, and probably should delay Barrett’s nomination (though Republicans will resist that vigorously).

“We cannot go back to work in the Senate unless everyone who has had any exposure to the White House over the last two weeks is tested,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on MSNBC on Friday.

“We can’t move forward on Amy Coney Barrett or anything else,” Murphy continued, “until we know whether there was some superspreader event at the White House, or at that debate, which has resulted in perhaps more Senate staff than Mike Lee contracting this disease.”

Indeed, as Jennifer Rubin points out, moving forward on Barrett at this point might violate guidelines from Trump’s own Centers for Disease Control.

Really, this is utter madness. Capitol Hill offices have already seen a steady stream of infections — yet many Republicans keep going out of their way to flout public health measures. Three senators and 15 members of the House, and more than 100 staffers and Capitol Hill workers, have tested positive.

Even GOP staffers are rebelling: A Politico scribe recently reported receiving “a flood of emails” from them complaining of being “forced” to come to the Hill without masks.

It’s hard to imagine an event like last Saturday’s, or indeed any of this, happening if Trump hadn’t set a tone throughout that required members of his party to treat coronavirus as either no big deal or as largely vanquished by his spectacular leadership.

This is not to absolve Republicans of complicity in setting this tone. Rather, it’s to say it came from the top, and many in the rest of the party eagerly adopted it.

“It was extraordinarily stupid to hold the event that way,” Konyndyk told us. “It reflects the recklessness with which this White House has been operating.”***My little brother-in-law used to be all about duplicating Jackass stunts he’d seen on TV. During one particularly stupid stunt, he ended up breaking his arm.

He was expecting pity. 

What he got was, “Dumb ass. What did you think was going to happen?”

Trump and his worshippers have been rejecting advice from Dr. Fauci. They’ve been flouting any recommendations. Trump is complicit in the deaths of almost a quarter million people. 

If you see your neighbor’s house is on fire, you’re not legally obligated to do anything about it. The right thing to do would be to alert the inhabitants and call 911. The heroic thing to do would be to rescue them. The asshole thing to do would be to laugh in your neighbor’s face, block the road so the firefighters can’t get to the house, and then stoke the flames. 

You might not have started the fire. But you’d be the reason they died. And you’d be the reason the houses all around you caught fire and the inhabitants died. 

And you’d look like an idiot standing in your front yard, wondering how the hell your house is on fire and bitching about why nobody is helping you put the flames out.

Dumb ass. What the fuck did you think was going to happen?***Who would've thought covid would be more successful at delaying the SCOTUS nomination than the Democrats in Congress?

So this is true, but it has nothing to do with the curriculum. Turns out when you step outside your bubble and share the human experience with people who don't look like you there is a tendency to see them as equally human with similar hopes, dreams, and fears.... at least if you are capable of feeling empathy.***Turns out reality has a left leaning bias.***Definitely. I’m getting very tired of dealing with them at my business as well. People who refuse to keep their masks above their noses are driving me crazy. I’m not confrontational, but I see hundreds of people a day (tiny gallery in a tourist town) and I insist on proper mask wearing in my shop. I have been subjected to the most incredible number of rude, moronic and out-of-touch harangues you can imagine, very often with a right-leaning political slant to them. I used to be so conscientious about reading right-wing news, too. But it’s getting to the point where I can’t stand it anymore.***I feel the same. They aren’t a political party any longer. They’re a cult. And a deadly one at that.***What I hate the most is their lack of knowledge. They completely ignore facts. Spewing lies and just plain garbage.***I despise modern conservatives. I always used to be a ""agree to disagree"" type but Trump has poisoned this country. Hardcore right-wingers have always been shitty people, but now there is a visceral hatred and I'm not afraid to admit it. Im not talking about people who voted Trump in 2016...it's the 2020 cult voter. Their views and actions are unconscionable.***what I'm really fed up with is the bad faith arguments. Anybody who supports Trump but still says any of the following: Biden communicates poorly, he gets handsy with women, his mental faculties are deteriorating, people who wish ill on the president are mean, etc. are clearly full of shit. If you had a problem with any of these issues then you obviously would not be a Trump supporter.

The card says moops.***One of the things I dislike about conservatives is that they're all ""proud patriots"" but don't really know, understand, or acknowledge our country's history outside of the context of that you'd learn in a grade school social studies textbook.

I made the mistake of looking at the Conservative sub yesterday and there was a post by someone foaming at the mouth about how some college professor had a test question that said something like ""Was the United States Constitution designed to perpetuate white supremacy and protect the institution of slavery"". They had a clickbait headline of ""Vanderbilt class of 800+ students forced to choose between calling Constitution racist or losing grade points"".

Well, if you're looking to make people who don't know the historical context of the document or remember things like the 3/5ths Comprimise angry then yeah, that clickbait headline will get people riled up and hate the ""Liberal Elite Universities"" or whatever bs they call it. But also, like, you can accept that the document has some racist elements to it and that over time we've worked (slowly) to overcome them, which in my mind, makes America truly great.

IDK, it's so frustrating. And I'm sad that I've lost friends that I've had for a long time because all they've wanted to do is berate me about ""liberals"" since 2016.***When I was younger I used to try as hard as possible to try to take the middle ground. I tried to listen to them, try to see their way in things.

Now that I'm older and have listened to what seems like every argument in the book from them, I have pretty much accepted the fact that they're all idiots.

Some people would say ""not all self professed conservatives are idiots"". My response to them is ""if they aren't idiots they wouldn't be conservatives"".***Sorry,I limited out on conservatives 40+ years ago.Exhaustive ""debates"" are futile.
Conservative ideology can be summed up in a word. 


ME.***Yup, to the point where I'm not interested in arguing anymore. They're a lost cause for the most part, and I'd rather take Ijeoma Oluo's advice on the subject: Give up on the racists because they don't matter, and instead use your time and energy to promote useful causes like sharing info about local ballot measures or boosting up candidates or campaigns you think will help.***Real, actual conservative here. I'm absolutely disgusted with the fake ass conservatives and republican party today. No spine, no desire or ability to stand up for what they used to consider their core beliefs. Just hearty eyes for trump. I'm done voting red, and have cut many people out of my life.***Sorry, about that. I try to be as polite and nice as possible.

I am conservative that was not happy about last election.

Best of luck on this election. I believe Biden will win and wish his presidency the best.***Don't let them get to you - that's their plan, so don't fall for it.  As long as they can LIE, DISTRACT, and CHEAT they won't let us discuss the issues.  That's what trump did during the debate - shut down Biden trying to discuss the issues...

Why am I against donald trump?

- because I love my Hispanic, Black, Muslim, and other minority friends
- because I feel compassion for the handicapped.
- because I believe in the beauty, respect and equality of women - ALL women
- because I love this country and I want the rest of the world to love and respect it, too.
- because I believe that spewing hatred, lies, and bigotry is the greatest threat we have to our very existence
- because trump and pence are both Human-Caused Climate Change DENIERS***It's exactly what you say. They will say things like the MSM just won't give Trump a break and only attack the GOP etc.. with negative news. The thing is there is literally NOTHING positive to say about Trump or the GOP at this point. What have they done? Tax cuts for the rich? Trade wars? Bungled a pandemic. I'm not clear on what they have actually done that benefits the people and is worthy of a laudatory article. Right wing news sites only deal in surface level arguments on why Trump and the GOP are good for this country but they ALWAYS leave out important details that would render their arguments invalid.***Yes and I'm surrounded by them.***Tbh I was sort of leaning right before 2020 but that's long gone***Before I even got to know him, I was accused of ""just hating Trump."" I was stunned and annoyed. I didn't hate him then and I don't hate him now. I am a Christian committed to non-violence. Hating is easy. Not hating is a challenge but it's worth it. When you hate, you lose control and your objectivity. Today, we honor Martin Luther King more in the breach than the observance. The result? The rightwing is able to use the lack of discipline of leftists against them.

First of all, the right wingers aren't ""conservative."" They've hijacked that word. The right is filled with reactionaries who want Big Daddy Government to enforce their social agenda. And what is their agenda? They want to enforce segregation and white supremacy at the point of a gun.***I've hated them ever since I can remember. I was raised in a red town, city, district and state. They're horrible and I try to avoid them as much as possible. Aside from politics I find them to be extremely boring and simple and they have such a low vibration on top of it all. There is very little, if anything, that can be learned from them. They are just too regressive to ever have anything to offer in a meaningful way. I can generally spot them from a mile away based on several criteria and being raised amongst them.***Yes... I get that feeling as well. They are repulsive political dinosaurs. Their ideology is on life support and they are clinging onto Boomer ideas for dear life. They are bottom of the barrel scum and the fact that we have to live under their rules makes me hate them more. 

Fuck them.***Not hate.  

I've gone in the opposite direction, and look at them as a complete joke and I cannot take them seriously, so I just poke fun/troll them when I see them having meltdowns online.***Not really. Exasperation is more the feeling. I remind myself that they are products of a closed circuit media consumption. There is an entire industry devoted to keeping them away from the rest of reality. I have biases, but I'm aware of that fact. They purposely hide from theirs because self-reflection seems to be a sign of weakness to them.***One of the topical traps I refuse to fall into with liberal, but especially my shrinking circle of conservative friends is to use the term hate. Going back years, well before the 2016 election, conservative friends would always try to control the narrative by framing the subject. For instance ""Why do you hate George W. so much?"", my answer always being I don't hate him but I very much dislike x and y policies and will do everything in my power to fight against such policies. If you can be cornered so easily into black and white stances such as love and hate there is no conversation possible. I am not being naïve here, as I am having no conversations with conservative friends and probably will not for several months after this election. When conservatives realize how thoroughly conned they have been over the years then maybe we can interact for the good of all Americans.***Yup, to the point that I really want nothing to do with them again.

I want access to education and healthcare to benefit them as well since this whole “blatantly target my political enemies in denying service to entire states” is authoritarian nonsense, but I don’t want them in my personal life or workplace and am happy not interacting with them again, nor doing business with them.  Already rejected one for a date pre corona.***Every time. I cannot work with them or talk to them or be related to them. Definitely no friend potential. No way.***They're not ""conservatives"". They may be Reactionaries, haters, bigots, know-nothings, or a number of other labels.

It boils down to them being anti-""anyone not just like me"".***ABSOLUTELY.  I never thought I could hate somebody I didn't even know, but yes I do.  I don't apologize for it either.***Cast your ballot and disengage. I don't believe a Trump supporter can be persuaded at this point.

I think the energy is better spent making sure fellow liberals get out the vote.***As a recovering Republican of over 10 years, I can relate. I visited the conservative sub, and it's just a bunch of MAGA nationalism. It's disgusting how far things have come. We're going to be fighting these anti-intellectuals for decades.***What’s not to despise? The heart of conservatism is selfishness, fear, and vengefulness all propped up by savage hypocrisy and self-righteousness. 

Whether that’s caused by or results in their all-consuming, delusional worldview and complete lack of introspection is unclear. But it makes me hate being human***I'm really glad you raised this question. It worries me that we're becoming so politically tribal. I've certainly noticed the hatred emanating from each side toward the other. It feels, to me, very much like zealous hatred, the kind of dehumanizing condescension that characterizes tribal warfare or religious crusades. Sometimes, when people are very caught up in such polarization, they completely lose sight of the myriad daily things they have in common with ""the others"" and see only the alien ideology. Wars and genocides are built on such foundations. It worries me.***dunno bout hate, but i sure do lose respect for people who keep saying stupid stuff they clearly dont believe themselves. plus i think of those folks as republicans, not conservatives***I see it too and I’m not even a liberal. As a matter of fact, they make me cringe most of the time.***[https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/j685mo/suspicious\_looking\_circle\_jerk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/j685mo/suspicious_looking_circle_jerk/) Thought this was relevant***Try r/Libertarian

Certainly not trying to sell you on libertarianism or anything, but there might be something there than actually challenges your beliefs.***Yes, dear lord yes. Even worse when it's your parents and they are getting older and they are set in their ways and are not open to new view points

Edit: words***I cant stand conservatives, but I also have a hard time with Liberals, who also equally have issues taking criticism and having meaningful debate over just falling back to claiming bigotry, racism or assuming you support Trump.***Yes.  I don't engage with them anymore for my own mental health.***Yeah they are pretty gross. I hated coming to this conclusion but some people are just fucking deplorable***Question why do we call them trumpsters instead of trumpets***I don't hate anybody, but this is a hateful ideology that will take years for the country to recover from......***I just hate people***Although i have never personally met one, i am convinced from reading US history that once there were in fact, educated, aware, compassionate Republicans.  i honestly believe that the beginning of their downfall began with Mr. Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon, wooing the former Dixiecrat racist fake-Christians into the GOP:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/26/what-we-get-wrong-about-southern-strategy/

But now, this generation of Republicans are the offspring of the Falwell false-Christian Evangelical minority (mislabeled as the Moral Majority).  This generation comes with the reawakening of the formerly hidden white supremacists /Neo-nazis /skinheads ... which Trump first called the Alt-Right, before soon after mixing them into his overarching MAGA cult.

The sacrilegious Right Wing has been in the business of swindling the spiritually naive for many years, and since they already regularly twisted bits of scripture out of context to pretend support for their hateful dogma, it was a simple enough work to expand that big, bold lie to include Republican ideology of Capitalist Greed, Toxic Masculinity, Patriarchy, and wars for oil and ""regime change"" as a form of politics.

The current ideology of the Right-Wing is literally founded on lies.  Lies that ignore facts, lies that deny science, lies that deny history, lies about the Bible, to finally create a Christofascist groupthink.

The Right-Wing does NOT believe in the separation of church from state.
In fact they have repeatedly tried to pass their wrongly-named ""Religious Freedom"" bills into law in roughly every state, which would legalize faith-based discrimination in public business.

If there are any old-guard Republicans left... they are the ones finally breaking out of the cult, and supporting Mr. Joe Biden for president.***Go to your window and in ten minutes that big YES you’re hearing is coming from jimmy in WI***Honestly, I used to have some friends who were conservative and until recently I thought we could all just get along.  This trump business really threw a spotlight on how massively screwy their beliefs are.  Nobody who supports trump is in my life now.  I purged.

If they aren't screaming for people like me to be killed for being a liberal, then they are tolerating and supporting people who are.  That's unforgiveable.  Trump and GOP are literally letting people die.  They are literally trying to prevent Democrats votes from being cast or counted.  This is no time to be namby-pamby about what side you are on.***If you interact with the right ones, I doubt this would hold true. Same can be said the opposite way for folks who meet the wrong liberals. Reddit is not the place for finding those folks tho, at least not the conservative subreddit. It bans you from commenting if you aren’t a conservative.***I don’t hate them but I have no respect or want to be associated with them.***No because not all conservatives are bad?***I think it happens to both sides. The difference is that they are being fed lies that make us seem like we are making bad-faith arguments. We all know that mainstream media is hard on Trump (possible bias) but they are reporting on the truth to the best of their abilities. Conservative media is provably lying to its audience and casting doubt on anything that doesn't support their narrative.  


This makes dialogue impossible. We need to move forward without them.***Yes. They lack compassion or reason,. It's depressing.***Don't be fooled, they are your brother, your sister. American politicians are more afraid of a united people than a partisan conflict. Don't let people's rhetoric divide you fam***There is a difference between being a ""bad"" person and an otherwise good person that follows a misguided philosophy.  Although, if you follow that philosophy and it is being lead by an infectious, racist, narcissistic, lying, bloated, orange, elephant seal with a bad wig, maybe you should look at other news media than Fox, Breitbart, and the like.***Conservative here. Just saying hi :)***What do you mean brainwashed by John Oliver? Do people think that is a thing?***Don't base your opinions of massive groups of people off of the most extreme subset of them online. I don't hate conservatives a little bit more each time I interact with them because most people in real life, including most conservatives, are just good people trying to do the best they can, regardless of whether they were raised with a republican or democratic identity (because for most people identity leads to beliefs, not the other way around).***From an American perspective...

""Social Conservatives"", yes. For instance, I dont care if someone wants to get a sex change. Or, women should have the right to choose whether or not to carry a child. This list goes on... and on 90% I generally dont agree.

""Fiscal Conservatives"", not really, kind of agree with *some* things. For instance, our military shouldnt pay for those sex changes IMO. However, I think clinics shouldn't be denied funding just because they provide abortions. So I gotta go 50/50 with ""Fiscal"" Conservatism - I think many points are well intentioned, but some go overboard.

""Conservatism"" in its base principle of where States rights supersede Federal, except where we've *granted* the Federal Government rights, is something I'll always support. It allows us to have states where abortion isn't allowed, and states where it is. The people get to decide how to run their local area, to fit their lifestyle better.

IMO a lot of conservatives have set aside this base principle.

Now, as far as not liking ""them"", meh, you gotta take everything online with a grain of salt. I've seen some pretty questionable shit on both sides, online.

Remember that ultimately this is the US, and it *is* US, not ""them"". Everyone has been duped by this two party system playing ""Good cop/Bad cop"" for too long. Instead of parties intelligently debating each other, they've got us fighting among ourselves.***Conservatives aren't so bad, it's the fascists, which make cup 80% of the Republican Party now, that are the problem..***Yes, inane losers.***This is a sign of a failing democracy***“Hate” is, however, a very strong word and a contentious word, because liberals do accuse conservatives of “Hate” when conservatives are trying to take away human rights. With reason, I believe, but still maybe a poor word choice for this context. But maybe you used it in a rather self-accusing way? I can get very angry at myself for sinking to their level in my own head (hopefully I don’t in mixed company). For instance, when I heard that Trump had gotten out of the hospital my first instinctive reaction was disappointment. Then I was very angry at myself indeed. I had promised myself never to wish for anyone’s death. I think the moral high ground is important for liberals to maintain, as much as humanly possible. History says we are going to win this battle in the long run. So I try to stick to my code of honor; I am NOT actually going to hit a customer with their mask below their nose calling ME a fascist for “forcing” them to wear a mask. However, it’s important to give yourself a break, too. We feel like we’re under attack. I love my country and feel that its basic tenets, democracy, progress and liberties are being undermined. I also don’t feel physically safe. So, if we sink to name-calling or juvenile threats once in a while...we apologize and keep on trying to do better.***Online, yes.  In person, no.  The internet makes us into vile antagonists that spew nothing but hatred and arguments.  But chat with someone in person and almost everyone tries to find common ground and understanding.  Unless it's your family member that you just can't stand anymore, you can generally have a real conversation with a conservative that humanizes you both.

The problem is that isn't the norm anymore in the US.***Most of the people in those subs arnt conservatives most of them are right wing nuts. My best friend is a small c conservative and we get along just fine. Have we had the odd heated conversation about politics of course we have does that stop us no. 
Other acquaintances who are just racist thugs I just have blocked and moved on from. There is a genuine conversation to be had between the right and the left it just won’t happen in places like this because he reasonable voices form the right (and left) tend to get drowned out.***I’ve actually engaged a bit with conservatives on the subreddits. Some of them are willing to have sane conversations. It really just comes down to core differences in moral beliefs and it’s hard to have good conversations about such a touchy subject.***The divisive media will be the undoing of America. That and the fact that the country’s collective IQ is about 25. We have lost critical thinking skills along with any interest in truth, honesty and integrity.***I think they just want lower tax bills but quite can’t say that out loud. They will argue on any topic towards that end.***This is so spot on. 

My personal journey: I was trying to give conservative family members a chance. I live in NYC. One of them reached out to check on me during the pandemic and the protests and acted happy to hear I was marching with BLM... then I rejoined Facebook and he’s on there bragging about being anti mask (he lives in Ohio, where my sister is a nurse, put in danger by idiots like him) and supporting Trump’s disinformation about anarchist cities or whatever. I’m done. They are a cult of angry, shapeless people.***Yup***I’m pretty conservative, at least regarding government spending.. However I believe in guns rights, gay marriage, pro choice, religion needs to get the fuck out of government, etc. I know a lot of people who would never consider voting outside republican though, and they’re all pretty reasonable rational people. Trump is the problem. This idea the “winning” means upsetting your opposition, not making the country better. Trump people would rather drink a little bleach if it meant the opposition would drink a lot. They’re more than willing to hurt themselves to hurt others. Set back the country, to “own the libs”. Etc. the Republican Party needs to distance themselves from people like that..***Interact with them in real life. This is the problem with the internet***Depends on the person, I interact with several conservatives who concede points as I concede points with them. The sycophants don’t change their minds. A great example of a conservative is George Will. Keep in mind that there are several who say facts don’t change people’s views. https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds. I don’t necessarily agree that this is the end all and be all of the discussion and I disagree with some of the conclusions but it is enlightening.***Classy.***You are not alone***No, I just feel sorry for them.***K***Agreed. I just stop interacting with people who aren’t going to vote blue. So tired of racists telling me all the “politics” that they know of. The only thing I know is my president will never start a war. Period.***I grew up in a conservative family and went to school in Georgia so a lot of the friends I made in college were conservative. There is a huge difference in conservatives pre-2016 and some of the farther right conservatives today. I used to be able to talk about topics with my friends and we could agree to disagree or even change each others minds. 

Nowadays every talk about politics I have with conservative family/friends devolves to one of the following topics: Obama, Hillary's emails, Hunter Biden, riots/protestors. I stopped hanging out with a few people because they just became so toxic. COVID-19 made things worse since some conservatives genuinely believe the pandemic is being extrapolated solely to hurt Trump politically. It's just not worth it anymore.***We love visiting your circle jerk subreddits as well.***As a conservative, this seems like a self fulfilling prophecy. There are plenty of conservatives to hate, as I would argue there are liberals in the same category.

The problem is that the craziest people tend to be the loudest. Every group is judged by their ugliest characters.

So I would encourage keeping an open mind to conservative ideas and look beyond the A-hole MAGA dude going on rants.***No, that's an immature stance. Being an adult means a level of emotional maturity where I can hold a conversation with people of opposing views. Being able to discuss other opinions rationally is what I'd consider the foundation of intelligence (critical thinking).

Without these two things you just end up being an immature stupid person. As a moderate, I ask questions and am open to dialogue and my mind being changed based on facts and arguments.***Thanks and we hate you fucking morons too***Ugh. My ex best friend of 14 years is a Trump supporter and conservative. Pro life, anti vax, the whole package. Whenever I try to talk to her about things, she half heartedly defends herself and takes it very personally. Then she proceeds to ghost me without ever giving any real answers to my questions. 
At least she believes in Covid-19, last I checked. But she refuses to watch the presidential/vice presidential debates and that's what makes me so upset. Willful ignorance is unacceptable.***So much hate from the party of “tolerance and acceptance” see the difference between liberals and conservatives is very basic. Conservatives don’t care what you do for the most part, just don’t bother us and try to make us think like you do. Liberals on the other hand have to force their radical beliefs down your throat and if you don’t agree with them then you’re racist, bigoted, etc. Thats not how life works, not everyone will agree with you. You do your thing and I’ll do mine and we will all get along much better***No more than liberals that express hate towards others.  Conservatism isn't the problem.  Our inability to see each other as humans is the problem.***Get help***yes***To the pit of my stomach.***Online? It tends to reaffirm our distrust of each other.


IRL? If politics comes up I try to steer the convo to something we both agree on to avoid shouting matches. It works and I can empathize more with them as people, even though I still disagree just as hard on most things. In personally talking with conservatives, it seems more apparent that they've been duped by Donald, just not  understanding how much damage he's doing.***As a moderate that participates in both liberal and conservative, can you give me some examples you're referring to?

Some observations I've noticed is many of their weird hatred for masks. Lastly, I would argue that your hatred for the other party is indeed proof of your being radicalized by the media.******Yeah because liberals aren’t at all known for their irrationality, biases, and echo chambering.

I see it on both sides, there’s some really dumb stuff. I wouldn’t say it’s more conservative or liberal but maybe I’m bias 🤷🏽‍♂️***Typical liberal. Full of hate. Nothing but hatred from you all, what happened to being “tolerant”? Such bullshit. I used to be a liberal even though I was raised by conservative parents. But I recently went back because I couldn’t stand the hypocrisy, constantly being offended by literally everything, and the seething hatred of anything remotely different than liberal thinking. I hope you see your hypocrisy some day.***If you're looking for a conservative that isn't annoying I would recommend the youtube channel Sargon of Akkad, and Akkad daily. He actually makes some pretty good points.***Because they use facts and logic to support their arguments and you base yours off of emotion and corrupt mainstream liberal media?***Yes, but the same is true for liberals.***Honestly it’s two sides of the same coin. I’m subbed to many liberal/left wing subreddits alongside many conservative/right wing subreddits. I consider myself economically conservative and socially liberal. There’s bullshit from each side and even if stuff pisses you off it’s good to keep calm and try and see other peoples points of view. Not saying that everything that’s said is necessarily smart but if you listen to people and have a conversation people are going to be more likely to listen to the idea you subscribe to.***As someone who frequents both liberal and conservative subs, I completely agree with you.

j8gae4,"I think people need a reality check. 

It was here before Trump and it will still be here after Trump because now their fascism has been normalized and accepted as a legitimate political philosophy. 

The Fox News and Facebook propaganda mills will still be pumping out lies 24/7 and convincing some to believe that Democrats are literally eating babies. All of the long term consequences of Trump's handouts to the wealthy, his dismantling of the government, the idiot trade wars, and the way they've let Corona spread will start hitting the economy once we can't pour trillions more of debt into it. 

Since the consequences of all that sabotage will show up during Biden's term, he'll get blamed by Republicans for all of it and Trump will be praised for the Obama economy he inherited and sabotaged. 

So even in the best case, Democrats will again need to un-fuck the country after four years of conservative policy and looting, somehow get our allies to trust us again, and do it all in the middle of an out of control pandemic and accelerating climate collapse. 

The biggest challenge for Democrats is trying to unify the country, and I'm concerned they will try to do that with their usual tactic of appeasement. If they do that, it won't work because appeasement never works with fascism. Republican leadership will not only continue to act in bad faith but also continue encouraging acts of violence against them, and it's only a matter of time before the right wing finds a populist leader that is as vile as Trump but not as stupid or incapable. 

The only way back from the brink is to crack down on the right wing terrorist training groups and propaganda networks hard as well as politicians that may be corrupted by foreign powers even if that means they have to lay charges against Republican politicians. If they don't cut out these cancers in the system, things will get worse. 

That's the nightmare that the Democratic party has in front of them, and remember that's best case. If they don't take the Senate and Presidency both in 2020, they're just fucked and we're all just fucked.***Trumpism will survive, with a smarter, more professional front runner.

That said, the Right feels resonance with Trump. They seek Fascist minority rule, and have already ditched Democracy in their pursuit of it. This will not cease if Trump loses next month.

The Right has become far more extreme. None will accept a Trump defeat, though many will just take to Facebook to rage. Some won't, some will resort to terrorism. The US plague of right-wing terrorism is about to get worse.***I think--hope?--people will be more than smart enough to realize that there is a non-zero number of people that don't care about facts, logic  or science once Trump loses. Hopefully he loses.

I'm embarrassed.


I feel that the USA has been compromised by everything that President Trump, his Adminstration, and all Republicans have supported and given voice to.


Our founding fathers are turning over in their graves.


We deserve better.

Trump is no Republican and Republicans need to stand up and admit it.***No apology needed; you took action to improve things, and thank you!  


Question: what do you normally watch for news?    


Not all conservatives are doing what you just did, and I'm wondering if ""where do you get your news"" is a big part of that.***I don't think you need to be ashamed of your vote when the goal of the disinformation put out there is to fool you. However, nobody is fooled anymore. Those who still support Trump know exactly who he is. They will put up with any amount of corruption because they agree with his white supremacist agenda. Then they try to marginalize critics by claiming they are all Far Leftists. I am a Lincoln Republican and I want my party back.***Thank you.  You always have the right to your own vote, but I appreciate the decency you’re showing now.  Let’s right the course for now so we can go back to arguing over mundane things like taxes in the future.  Love to you and yours!***This is brave and takes a lot of courage. I too am a veteran, and I respect the hell out of this.

I’m not always enthused with the Democratic Party, but for the life of me I cannot understand how anyone can look at Trump and want THAT to be our country’s head of state. He is cruel, stupid, shameful, and in my opinion NOT patriotic (and that’s a conversation in and of itself).

Thank you for your service, and thank you for being a patriot.***Great to hear! I’m on the far left but stories like this always make me happy. It’s never too late to realize your mistakes and course correct.***Right there with you OP.  Never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in my life until last week.  Country before party.

I grew up in a very conservative house and unfortunately my parents are still supporting Trump, and will only get thier information from Fox News. I can’t stand it, it makes me so upset that they can’t see Trump and his entire administration is full of liars, hypocrites, thieves and racists. I actually had a very long screaming match with my dad on Friday because he had no argument on why Trump should get re-elected other than Biden “can’t finish a sentence”. Couldn’t logically defend anything Trump does. 

I don’t think I’m ever going to change his mind, but I would like to see if there’s anything that at least might make sense to him. 

I’m really happy for you and I hope more can do the same. This election isn’t about Republican vs Democrat, it’s about removing a dangerous administration that has been undermining national stability.***Thank you.  Most of us on the left aren’t very excited about Biden either, TBH.  But at this point, we have to defeat Trump.  If the man’s ever done anything good in his life, it is that he united most of the country against him.***No need for expalaination or apology here. Welcome - and thank you for your humility.***Maybe I am biased so take what I say with a grain of salt, but from where I view the matter, Donald Trump as President represented Conservatism in America in its purest form. If it repulses you as a lifelong conservative, its because you were used to the moderated and watered down form that Republicans used to use to get themselves elected, but Trump finally enabled them to ditch the moderation and push the USA straight towards fascism.

We never should have allowed conservatism to go so far. I sometimes wonder why we even bothered with an American Revolution at all if we keep exalting conservative values like hypernationalism and hypercapitalism.......which were the same values held by the BRITISH in the late 18th Century!***Can I ask you why you used to believe in them....?***What is it about conservatives that they simply cannot develop empathy until they literally hurt people they claim to care about.***Congrats.***Don't forget every single son of a bitch that was elected and supported him or sat on their hands are just as guilty as him.  Remember that the next time you vote - the overwhelming majority of them helped him.***Thank you!***Doing America right, thank you.***Welcome!  

 I know this wasn’t an easy decision for you to make and, hopefully, our country heal our deep wounds.

In the meantime, welcome my friend.***We feel your pain, and will reform the GOP, pretty sure it's going to be dragging the GOP into legal accountability while they kick and scream about oppression....***It's too late. We're screwed. 

The economy is not coming back anytime soon, COVID19 will be endemic for probably 3-5 years, 350 - 400k Americans will die, the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit Courts are packed with extreme right wing Republicans under the age of 50, we made no progress on climate change and actually expanded our pollution levels when we were already low on time and we can't undo it with weak Dems Biden/Harris.

And to top it off, we're broke. Our debt just passed our 1 year annual GDP and is skyrocketing thanks to COVID costs, stimulus checks, unemployment benefits and corporate bailouts. 

Our social security is a mess and because of the money printing, the dollars you get with your social security will hardly buy anything and our elderly will be impoverished.

This chart is only up to 2019. For 2020, it will show a spike to 28 Trillion dollars of debt so it will be almost *vertical* at the end. 

We were headed for a decline as a great Superpower, just like say the British, but instead of being like the US was in 1939 prior to WW2 (a large but respected and prosperous nation) we are going to back to 1839. A backwater, racist basket case of a nation headed toward a civil war.

I don't harbor too much resentment though, because the conventional wisdom was that Trump would get impeached within a year or two. Remarkably, he has survived impeachment and everything else. Maybe it was manifest destiny in reverse.***You have my utmost respect. You're not letting labels like democratic and republican stop you from seeing what's wrong.  Thank you***I forgive everyone who voted for Trump because they had to follow their Republican past as long as they don't currently support him it's all good.

But when Murdoch went full right-wing propagandist in the 90's, the Post went with him.***The NYPost was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton. Maybe at some point it was a legitimate newspaper.

It's definitely been a trash right-wing tabloid since Murdoch bought it in the 70s though.***NYPost is not nytimes. 

Always was an alt-right mouthpiece. Not reputable *at all*. Hence why they're still allowed and treated as a news source on Reddit.***The New York Posr has been a Murdoch owned tabloid cmitted to yellow journalism for over 40 years.

jbgwr8,"These types aren't worth arguing with. His mind is already made up and is not open to new ideas, no matter how well thought out or how much evidence there is to support your argument. 

But, fwiw...the modern day trump supporting ""Christian""  is truly something to behold. I see them as being some of the biggest hypocrites on planet earth. 

*Things Jesus taught about:*

-how to treat immigrants 

-caring for poor and vulnerable 

-healing the sick

-loving your neighbor 

-nonviolence

-corruption in religious institutions 

*Things he did not talk about:*

-abortion

-LGBT rights

Trump's agenda is immoral and incompatible with the teachings of Christ. And for the record, I'm not a Christian but used to be. Was raised in an evangelical Christian home, went to church 3x a week, went to a private Christian school, and was a true believer. The blatant hypocrisy pushed me away. They focus almost exclusively on what other people do with their genitals to the point that the most important, substantive teachings of Jesus are almost completely ignored. They judge and condemn rather than empathize and forgive. 

There are some more open, caring communities of Christians who actually live their values and make an honest attempt to follow Christ's teachings, but white evangelicals have really ruined it for a lot of people.***For starters, Planned Parenthood has never killed a baby. That's probably a really good place to start.***This pisses me off.   Is this old white guy the one who is appointed to make decisions for women?   Each woman makes her own decision.

jbjh7o,"First and foremost, Biden and Harris are pitching a perfect game essentially. Despite what some might have you believe, they've been gaff free. They've had no real missteps, and they've reached out to nearly every voter you can think of. 

When campaign organizers think about dream scenarios in terms of how their campaigns go, this is the best case. They've raised nearly a billion dollars in less than a year. Turnout models are predicting record numbers. Polling has them above 50% in many places. We're still basically 3 weeks out and more than 12% of last elections voters have already voted. They have more than 10 paths to victory, while the other side has basically just 1. It's going as well as it could. 


Also: this country is amazingly resilient. We've seen our people get blasted with firehouses, gunned down by police, burned our community centers, and we've always persevered. We've had terrorists, foreign and domestic, attack us and try to bring us to heel, and we've always persevered. We've fought civil wars, lived through pandemics, and depressions that left millions homeless and hungry, and always persevered. We've fought amongst ourselves about if we should change the constitution, if we should change the courts, if we should protect workers, if we should allow basic freedoms to residents of our country before... And we always eventually get it right. 


America is not perfect. We get many things wrong, but the defining American trait is to learn, and do better. With every passing generation we realize we can do better. What we think is common sense our grandparents thought was progressive and often too far. But, this country does not stay formed in their image after we become the responsible.***Honestly, what has helped me lately is seeing the voter turnout. People willing to stand on line for hours *on the first few days polls were open* to vote. I said this in another thread- a surge in mail voting can be written off as a side effect of covid, but this burst of early in-person voting indicates that people are motivated. I genuinely believe we are going to vote him out. And I am thrilled to be a part of it.***Is there anything you could do? Yes, Vote! Then have you considered volunteering for Joe campaign?

I think that would be a more productive way to respond instead of panicking, and you may feel better.***You’re not alone in panicking. As an RVAT from a Republican community in PA, I know not to trust the PA polls projecting the state to decisively turn blue, because I know **many** Trump supporters **do not** answer polls. But they will vote on Election Day.

Trump knows PA will be close...that’s why he’s been assailing the various voting systems of the state for weeks now. And honestly...I’m scared that PA could vote red. It really could...and we’ll get four more years of “It is what it is.”

The worst President the United States has ever had - a Criminal in Chief - has a fair chance of winning this election. That says a lot about the state of this nation.

People thunderously applaud when Trump calls racial sensitivity training “sick ideas.” When he refuses to denounce white supremacy or Q’Anon. Calls CNN bastards for paying attention to COVID victims (one would think Trump would have **just** a bit more sympathy, but nope). Calls Dr. Fauci an idiot.

By the way, I hope he’s confronted on this in the final debate. I hope he’s confronted on the fact that he started off **his own** National Character Week by calling Dr. Fauci an idiot and wishing he could fire him! 

But here’s the thing...a Trump Presidency can be tolerable **if** the Senate is flipped and the House stays Blue. If the Blue takes over Congress, they can block most of what Trump wants. Not all unfortunately, but most.***Yes. Turn off the TV and look around at what’s actually happening in your life. Realize that Trump has no effect on your day to day life***How awesome is it gonna be, when your nominee is indicted on bribery? Fuck you and your party******I love how people are trying to flee the safest and most desireble place on earth that people risk life and limb to seek sanctuary in just because you don't like what you read about the president...


I almost popped a gasket when I realized liberals were trying to sink Goya foods and their hispanic employees because the man who runs the company was appreciative that Trump signed the Hispanic Prosperity initiative, investing money into Hispanic communities and schools. 

 Everyone decided to do their best to create hispanic unemployment... Because it was a thing that came from trump. If you ask me, that's pretty racist to intentionally keep a ln entire race down because you don't like whose trying to help them ..

jff7fs,"The Democrats should hang Trump around the necks of Republicans for the next generation.***It will depend on Biden.

He's made it clear that America needs the Republican party - else we becomes a one party state and that's not good for anyone.  Biden has also signaled he would elevate some republicans to positions of power within his administration.  If he plays his cards right, these moderate republicans could define the future of the party, allowing for a much healthier political environment.***They will pretend to have amnesia and act like all their spineless cowardly behavior never happened. They’ll go back to talking about their false flags of Jesus, abortion, and gun control. Eventually get back in power in someway and go back to helping rich people become richer. 

Sound about right???***I have a request for the entire liberal community. 
If Biden/Harris achieve the decisive victory that the rate of early voting is hinting at we must all initiate a sustained social media campaign that continually reinforces that fact that this election was a total repudiation of GOP politics. Just say exactly that on social media. 
We must shape the perception. the GOP will spin and offer a reductive “it wasn’t that bad. Our policies are good, people just didn’t like Trump”. 

Don’t let them set the narrative. Keep telling everyone it was a devestating loss for them and the American voters rejected their platform.***We have to fight every election to completely destroy them.  2018 was Stalingrad.  This year is Kursk.  We keep fighting until we reach Berlin.  And then we keep fighting after.***If they lose in a blue tsunami (240+ Democratic House Seats, Biden, 52+ Democratic Senate seats) then I think they gently course correct and talk about 'getting back to core conservative principals'...kind of like a modernized ""Contract with America"" pitch, without directly criticizing Donald Trump for fear of losing his supporters.  Because let's face it, a good 80% of the GOP now is mild to rabid Trump Supporters.  Throwing him under the bus probably won't help much.  But 'moving forward' while trying to energize them and attract more independents will get them ""back in the game"" so to speak.

If it's not a blue tsunami, but the Democrats do well (225-235 House Seats, Biden wins, but GOP holds the senate) they'll stick with Trumpism and try to wrap it up in a more palatable package.

If Trump wins, regardless of what happens elsewhere (although if Trump wins then probably the GOP holds the senate at a minimum, and Dems  lose some leverage in the house if not losing it outright...) then they'll triple down on Trumpism and go full Q-Anon and Dems are largely neutered.  Maybe 1-2 more SC justices in a second term, easily approved by the Senate.  Absolutely no restraints on Trump's power.  Dark days.***More of the same.   Dirty tricks, hypocrisy, corruption, etc.***It's not really complicated for the Republicans and in most ways it will be much easier than the Trump years.  You gotta remember, it's really, really, really, *really* easy for Republicans to gin up rage among their followers when they are out of power.  It's their natural state.  The right-wing media loves nothing more.  They convinced themselves Obama of all people was the antichrist.  The problem is when they actually catch the car they were chasing and actually need to govern, like now.  But there will be no meaningful internal audit or expulsion of pro-Trump or anti-Trump heretics.  There will be no major changes in ideology or policy.  ""Conservative"" now and for a long time basically just means tax cuts for the rich & cutting back regulation for favored industries.  That will stay because that's what the donors want.  Trumpism is basically just fear and resentment of an increasingly diverse, urban, secular society.  That won't change because that's what motivates the base.  They just need to nominate someone like Nikki Haley in 2024 and cut the rough corners off Trumpism a bit, but not too much so people can still read the dog whistling.  Rely on democrats to predictably fail to vote in 2022.  Rely on something--anything--imperfect happening in Biden's presidency and blame him for it.  Even if Biden wins by 10 points, they just need to target converting 5% of the of voting population to switch in the next election, and they have the extremely low-hanging fruit in front of them in the form of nominating a normal-ish human being instead of the man-child in the White House now.  Biden's probably too old for a second term anyway, and there's no guarantee Kamala Harris or whoever else gets the nomination in 2024 will appeal to persuadable voters as much as Biden.  

Trump could complicate things by trying to keep the party reins, but I think he probably ultimately doesn't even try and I'm not sure they'd stick with him as a 1-term loser anyway.  Typically parties move on and while Trump isn't typical, I think enough people in the party will be able to rub a few brain cells together and admit that he's not the candidate to get them back to the White House.***they will simply forget that such a man existed and will state how hard they fought against the the guy

they all should be locked up***The GOP is gonna go to shit after Texas flips. They've already almost permanently lost the house, and after the same happens to the presidency, their only shot in the future is the senate. I'm pretty sure Biden will pack the courts, so that's also done for the Republicans. There will be no future Republican party.***Unless they purge the teabaggers out of the party, nothing will change. 


Teabaggers were the rino's the whole time.*****What should happen:** another republican can't get elected anywhere for anything and the Republican name goes by the wayside like the Tories & Whigs - it takes 20 years for the conservatives to regroup and in that time the US institutes National Healthcare and everybody agrees that its untouchable.

&#x200B;

**What will happen:** Biden wins the election, The Lincoln Party calls in its debts saying they helped get Biden elected. The Democrats move further to the right because of they now owe TLP. No movement on Healthcare or anything else progressive and the cycle repeats itself. The Right moves farther right; and the next Trump is just as shitty from a policy perspective, but more polished and ""presentable"" - like Paul Ryan***I highly doubt they would go back to their original ways as most Republicans nowadays condemn George Bush***I genuinely hope they help to shift the political spectrum back towards the left. We do need a conservative force in this country, but the current GOP has gone past conservative into something that benefits no one but themselves. 

Also, in all honesty, Biden is a fairly conservative/centerist candidate. If the GOP shifts more towards the center it'll make room for more liberal democratic candidates.***I think that they should make a new party (called the Old Republicans or the Lincoln Party or something), a party of conservatives, but not... this.

And we go back to bipartisanship.

That's my hope.***One of two things will happen, in my opinion. 

We could see a complete route of the party. If the Democrats pack the court and make DC and PR states and kill the filibuster. The Republicans could be denied control of both the SC and the Senate... more or less permanently. More states are turning blue. That gives the Dems time to undo gerrymandering and pry Republicans out the local races and deny them there House leadership. And then maybe we can kill the Electoral College. Bam, Republicans are fucked. M
Now it's a Dem vs Progressive race nationwide. 

Or... the Democrats won't use the power they have been elected into. They will let the whole cycle repeat. They may pack the Court, but they won't add any Blue states or kill the filibuster. We face the exact same challenge in 4 years, but the Republicans are more rabid than ever.

They are an existential threat to democracy, our alliances, and the planet. 

Republicans would do it to the Dems if they could. Use the power first, Pelosi, or risk fascism again down the line.***Unless the Democrats grow a pair and prosecute Trump to the fullest extent of the law, I don't think he's going anywhere and I believe he will still control the GOP base. He's become the most powerful voice in the party and the party platform that was just agreed to simply states that the GOP platform is to ""support the agenda of Donald J Trump"". He's by far the most popular politician in the Republican voter base. Either throw his ass in prison where he belongs and he can no longer tweet, or the GOP will NOT move on from Trump until Trump dies. They're too far gone now and they can't turn back because Trump controls their base no matter what happens in the election.***Answer: The GOP hasn't changed under Donald Trump, they were just unmasked. After Trump they will commit their propaganda machine to putting ""a"" mask back on, while changing the narrative of the Trump administration to a positive outcome. 

Further, as they've now thoroughly compromised the courts, they will increasingly go to the Courts to overrule any laws that don't align with their agenda. This will work, and the US will continue its' decline.***I totally agree with you, a reckoning is coming.  I think the elected Republicans who hold onto their office will try to immediately distance themselves from anything Trump in the short term.  Then, in the years that follow,  as more revelations come out and the complete scope of corruption and the rest of the party's complicity in it, the entire country slowly turns against all Republicans and the party dies.  5-10 years from now there might still be two major parties in the US, but I don't think Republicans will be one of them. Trump has killed the party of Lincoln.***trumplicans (i.e. not the real republicans who've spoken out against him) like mcconnell, graham, jordon, gaetz and anyone else who has enabled trump needs to be thoroughly investigated, audited and (if/where crimes are found d to have been committed) charged and convicted.

the entire system needs to be rebalanced to ensure nobody as wholly unqualified ever holds the office again. there needs to be a massive cleaning of house followed by bi-partisan re-unification.***We ALL need to remeber that trump is the SYMPTOM and the republicans are the deasese that resulted in trump not only gaining power but being able to ABUSE that power and totally overstep his constitutional and traditional bounds  for 4 years.   

Every single republican, ESPECIALLY the ones decrying him now, that did not vote for impeachment are complicit in his actions since his election.    

They deserve to reap the rewards of their actions.***Dear Americans, a much needed *reality and sanity* check.

Your GOP, when it screams ""extreme left"" about Biden. That is **actual center right ""policies""** in the **rest of the world**

GOP would be classified as an **extreme right ""party""** in most democratic countries.

Every four out of the five white males that I grew up with are red-pilled. A lot of young white males are soaking up the alt right agenda.***The Republicans are going to double down on Trumpism.

If I were the Biden campaign, I'd dangle immunity for anyone outside Trump and his family, like a bloody steak over piranhas, and just advertise that each deal will get weaker than the last.***Honestly,  just put your efforts into defeating them. I don't want to play thought experiment with them. They don't deserve the time and attention.***Maybe it is time, for those who really despise what the GOP became, to create a new party, with serious people and not a bunch of mobsters wannabes***I want the Republican Party to die for accepting help from a hostile foreign power to maintain their own power.***More obstruction***I think Trump has ruined the 'Republican' brand name. They might have to come up with an entirely new name. 
I wouldn't be surprised if they try for the name 'Reaganite.'***They are going to need to find a strong and traditional republican leader on their side to reign in the extremists BS.  They need a leader who will call out their BS nonsense, willing to risk their own political career to change the party.  

Otherwise, I can see it being more obstruction, lying, BS.  That means more election cheating on their side.  I don't see them moving on after Trump.*****Upfront:** I am not a liberal or Democrat and will not be voting for Joe Biden

I really do appreciate your attitude in framing these issues. I think you are presenting this thread in a way that doesn't demonize a group of people and encourages discussion.

I think the GOP for the most part will stay the same in terms of ideology. I think they will be relieved that they don't have a toxic leader leading their party. 

I hope they can get younger leadership akin to the Squad. Conservatives deserve a group of young and energetic representatives rather than Mitch.***I think tucker Carlson will run***It’s pretty clear the Republican strategy going forward. They’re clearly going to get things done from the judicial branch instead of legislative and executive. All they have to do in Congress is stonewall and obstruct, which they’re really good at. Then they can have their impact through roll backs and deregulation through the courts.

Trump doesn’t even really matter outside of the distraction.  His fascism and racism just help excite their base.***Eh.  They're not terribly different than they were before him.  He's just the loudest/most shameless cheerleader they've had.  The only difference maybe will be that they have to remain the pro-Putin party lest they cast doubt on how cozy Trump was with Russia.

I think theyll learn that he was effective at a few things, so their next candidate will be boisterous and shamelessly full of shit because that appeals to their demographic.

I think theyll also learn he was hopelessly incompetent and will course correct to someone who isnt legitimately stupid.

I think both parties will learm that old isnt gonna work anymore.

So...  2024 primary will probably be Paul Ryan vs. Mitt Romney and the winner will determine if theyre Trumps GOP forever after or not.  Probably Paul Ryan.***Another shit tide on schedule in 2 years. Propaganda: Guns. God. Abortions. Government spending. Mexicans. Hell, maybe they’ve learned their lesson that they can’t keep power unless they go to war, and they’ll push us into war in the next administration.***Well written post OP and I agree. The optimist in me hopes that if nothing else, at least we remember as a country that we’re **one** country, with common goals and needs, and maybe we can start working together to truly address systemic racism (aka the “New Jim Crow”), education, and a basic right to health care. I know ACA isn’t perfect, but at least with it, I wasn’t more terrified of surviving cancer than of dying of it (because I face potentially being bankrupted multiple times over or forced to do without medical care due to preexisting condition denials).***Ol' Charlie Koch is going to have a ball rebuilding the GOP.***Maybe I'm naïve, but I'm hoping that this will become an opportunity for ranked choice voting and the dissolution of the electoral college to take hold. Extreme partisanship is hugely detrimental to our country (which I say as a staunch liberal). If candidates actually had to court people who may see them as a 2nd or 3rd choice, things might change for the better. And if the votes of people in California and New York mattered as much as the votes of people from Ohio and Florida, we'd be a more democratic country.***The Republican Party will have to undo the harm done to the party over the last four years. I myself was a registered Republican for many years before the party was high jacked by the extreme right which includes evangelicals, tea party, white nationalists, conspiracy theorists, you know the lot.

The Republican Party will have to pivot, but they will be marginalized because the trend is swinging towards American progressives in favor of gay rights, racial equality, education , housing, wealth inequality etc.

Today the Republican Party is made up of largely older white males entrenched in biased thinking completely closed off from meeting somewhere in the middle, which would be the sensible thing to do.

Since the Republican Party will become a minority party, as it should, it will leave an opening for other parties to form, some which will be very much more of the same Trumpism like nationalist or white supremacist parties. These parties won’t do much harm, but they will continue to expose the continued stench of our racist history.

It will be up to the Democratic Party to help Shepard us out of these dark times.***Don't see how the party can go back.  I can see a fracture before a reversion.  Politics in general could use a real overhaul.  Civility has disappeared.  The party needs to find that again.  We need to find a way back to working for the people and not just for a win.  If the GOP tries to find another Trump to lead their party, and the current division continues, the country as a whole is in for a some dark days.***If Trump loses, even by a wide margin, I believe a lot of the GOP won’t necessarily pull out of the Trumpism spiral. That is largely to do with the right wing media ecosystem that fuels the kind of division and fear mongering that Trump embodies. I don’t believe that train is slowing down any time soon. Plus they have a captive base they want to keep fired up over the next four years which makes any concession to the democrats unlikely. 

That being said, without Trump at the helm, I think there’s more room for more Republicans to explore different approaches to creating a conservative coalition that could gain traction in the primaries. I seriously hope that there’s enough Republicans that take this as a wake up call, and maybe we can get back to some sort of civil discourse. But I wouldn’t hold my breadth just yet.***Republicans after Trump is out of office: Trump? Trump who?***So much of what fuels the anti-liberal sentiment stems from gun culture. I think if a democrat candidate ran in 2024/28 (depending if Biden goes for a 2nd term) with an agenda of pro healthcare and pro 2nd amendment, they would siphon away so many votes from republicans. 

As terrible of a problem as gun violence is, it is minuscule compared to healthcare. Democrats need to choose their battles wisely.***If history is any guide, they will go full steam ahead like trump never existed, they will pearl clutch every investigation into the trump crime family, they will obstruct all that they can. So all in all business as usual unless we can tear them out roof and branch***I’d say republicans in office will be forced to refine their positions. As a conservative, my disagreements with Trump’s choices has caused  me to refine my own.***In 2024? Well they will have to elect a new candidate to run  same as usual***I mean...I just think it’s not safe to think in those terms yet.***It's a long way from over. Don't count Trump out just yet. I don't like him nor will I vote for him.....but he is much stronger than the polls indicate.***Nikki Haley will become our first female president. Trump will be in the rear view mirror. Life will go on as it has.***One thing's for sure,things were already changing when it comes to Democrats and Republicans, for better or worse, but Donald Trump pretty much sped up the progress since he started up in the last elections.

I can't see that his leaving office would bring either side back to normal just because he leaves. He left his mark, and not a good one, and now the future of both parties will continue to move forward off of that.

The only way that they will go back to where they were is if either the people affiliated with the parties, that is the masses and not the politicians, start calling the politicians, media and others within their parties that are on the extreme side of things on their shit and gain control over what has essentially become a mess of these parties, or the people who are more center minded and centered politically need to vote outside of these parties.

There were plenty of candidates with in these parties, as well as outside, but these parties only force one person in only these two parties in the end. This is why they've gone in the direction they have. Again, Trump streamlined the process just by being Trump.

These are things that anybody can do. I never care about who and what people vote for, but I do care that we are all properly educated enough to make the best choices and call their own politicians out just as much as any other.

I know this question was more directed toward the GOP, but it should be acknowledged that the parties are an absolute mess right now.***Biden is exactly a lefty***Some of them will find their way into the Biden administration according to Biden.***i refuse to do any business with those people.Just saying. and if he loses just the fact of all the laws republicans broke will keep trump and his people in the news for years to come.***Today's Republicans will re-brand themselves, run as Democrats and continue representing corporate interests after taking their money.***They'll do the time warp again- just a step to the left, then a jump to the right, but it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insaaaaaane.

I can only hope the youth have an understanding how decisions now affect them later in life, but usually the youth doesn't fathom that.

Get out and vote people. Blue wave.***it won't take much, but we need to win by 5 million this time. cause hillarys 3 million more votes for then agent orange wasn't good enough

Info about an organization that helps you help your friends vote too.  Anything and everything to get people the resources they need to actually get out and vote, and show them that it matters to me.  Every day I just find something, post it, and get the word out.  

It doesn't take much time or effort but my hope is that if enough of my friends and family see these posts they might take it to heart and actually get off the couch and vote if they weren't going to already.  Let's run up the score so far that no amount of election interference will be able to cover up.***My daughter voted with me in the primary in March at the age of 17. She’s 18 now and I made sure she understood the policies and made sure she voted. Young people just don’t care enough because they feel invincible and that it doesn’t matter.

They believe they're going to be affected somehow by the tax on people who make more than $400,000 a year. when the stock market was way up and their 401k was way up for the year they couldn't care less about what Trump was doing wrong or illegal.***Who the fuck is 'on the fence' at this point?***Show them a Trump speech.***SECRET CHINESE BANK ACCOUNT***Do these folks know that 223,000 Americans have died while Trump has been downplaying the pandemic from the beginning and still downplays its mortality rate.

jh58jt,"Submission Statement:

Liberal commentators have been dismayed at the breezy waving of the 'spycops' bill through parliament, in what they claim is a rupture with the British democratic tradition. Yet as Eleanor Penny points out, the blades of state power now trained on domestic dissent were first sharpened in the empire.

Edit for non-UK readers: it does assume that readers are already familiar with it, which isn't viable in communities centered on the USA instead of the UK. Here are two overview articles from the BBC and The Guardian, the summary of the bill and a link to the bill's text on the UK Parliament's website.

jmfefs,"I already have a few bottles of red lined up for Tuesday night. I know we will probably not know the pres race that night, but seeing the Senate fall to the blue would be a win no matter. Here's to hope.***>Are we that lacking in education? How do we have such a severe critical thinking problem?

Yes. Completely by design. In addition to [this list](https://spy.com/articles/gadgets/video-media/best-political-books-anti-intellectualism-america-amazon-109364/) I would add [*Manufacturing Consent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) as explanatory texts***I am surprised and saddened about just how much this election has me on edge.    I have been through many election nights which were tense but none with that sense of dread days before.

Historically rhe candidates were not so polar opposite.  This election though a vote for Trump really is a vote for hatred.   In 2016 Trump supporters saw a candidate without political baggage and wanted to give him a shot and hope for the best.   I get that.   Now 4 years later we see what he broughtnto the table and it is a steaming pile of shit.   So now voters voting for Trump are not voting on hope,  but voting that they want more of his steaming pile of shit.  

It makes me feel like we are all lesser people for this.   This election is going to divide us more because the Trumpers are proud of their shit eating and they can't wait to give us more of it.    If you look at Trump in 2020 and come to the conclusion that is the future you want for yourself and for your society then I don't know how we progress from there. 

Tuesday night is going to be tense.   Because this election sets the tone not just of the presidency, but of the people that make up this nation.  I want to believe more us are not shit eaters but I am preparing myself to see that we are.***It should be 538 to nothing.***What's really bad is what I'm living with. Almost every single friend that I grew up with is a Trump supporter. Almost every single family member I have is a Trump supporter. Thank God not all, but it is really disheartening. I cannot understand it because it seems so obvious to me that he is the absolute worst president of all time and will end up costing them what they believe in if he gets the power that he wants.***i’m literally a single-issue voter here and that issue is covid. never would i vote for a democrat but one has a plan and one pretends it doesn’t exist and has misled millions into waiting for a perfect magic vaccine. i just want life to return to normal again.***Yeah, I feel sick to my stomach. It's so horrifying, isn't it? This slow rot had been creeping in right under our noses for years. All I know is I will never take my civic responsibilities for granted again. A democracy relies on its people to preserve it.***I feel at the moment and for the last 3 years it's been hard to gauge how many people in the US are actual disgusting die hard Trump supporters.
I say this because I understand so many Republicans voted for him in 2016 for their particular conservative reasons and not because they actually like the guy.

But THIS election will show us exactly how many crazy fuckers there are in the US.
I truly believe many many Republicans who voted for him will not do so this time now that they've seen how he is.

So I'm very anxious and curious to see what the popular vote is this time so I know for real what kind of country I live in.***The internet has everyone so far up their own butts that they actually think that ""voting trump to own the libs"" is a worthy endeavor, like it's just something they can sit back and watch, without real-world consequences that will affect them.

They're cheering for a fat orange bully like it's a football game and their side is cheating like hell, but they can all go home safe and sound and the game stays in the stadium.

They're wrong.***Trumpism is a cult. Trumpets are cult members. They need to be deprogrammed just like scientologists.***I share your anxiety. I live in the Netherlands and have no direct skin in the game. However, I do social media analysis for our government and every time the angry orange spews his hatred it riles up our nutters. The world will be such a more stable place outside of the US as well when conspiracy Don is out of office.


Example: Trump says doctors are committing fraud by fudging the number of corona cases. Result, our nutters (on the opposite side of the ocean, mind you) think it’s a good idea to threaten to infiltrate our hospitals and uncover the truth. The police had to issue a warning to hospitals in the east of our country to watch out for conspiracy nutters infiltrating and potentially attacking hospital staff.

Anyway, I wish you luck and I hope for a good outcome. Stay safe and healthy, my American friends.

Given the lowering standards of public education and lack of critical thinking skills honed by religious belief PLUS a huge television and newspaper propaganda network funded by billionaires, it should come as no surprise that America is at this point.  

That facebook and other social media have added their micro-targeting, behavioral-modification and hugely addictive mind control technology to the pile is just the icing on the cake.***Trump supporters are uneducated idiots that keep voting for Trump due to their love for racism, that's why.***Unfortunately, Trump is the symptom, not the disease.  Unchecked greed, racism, and an uneducated electorate created this phenomenon and without  fixing those problems we are only setting ourselves up for a more clever version of Trump later.

I actually thought he would have made more progress towards authoritarianism by now but he is remarkably inept.  We got a freebie chance to course correct and if we don’t take it, we don’t deserve democracy anyway.***It sure seems like the modern conservative movement that began in 1980 has had it's full 40 yr story arc and is about to implode .... And yes it is a great relief to get to chat with people who share our values =)    The Trumpers may have succeeded in ushering in a new era in American politics, but not quite the way they may have intended ......***Trump supporters are in a whole different world of information. They want Trump to be seen absolute ruler to protect us from tyranny. And because they don't know what words mean they have no idea the irony of this statement.***More fencing going up around the WH tells me all I need to know. He’s scared shitless. And so am I.***As a person who studies the flow of information (I’m an information sciences major), I would like to largely blame the media rhetoric for Trump’s 2016 win. The only way for the Republican Party to stay in power is to convince people they actually care about them and when that doesn’t work they either convince people not to care at all (aka don’t show up to vote), intimidate people at the polls, and then try and throw out ballots. I don’t believe that Trump even has the favor of half the country, it’s just Trumpists are the loudest and Republican loyalists are being complicit. 

At this point, the people who are still voting for Trump have put Trump on a god tier and there’s nothing he can do wrong. His campaign left people in the cold? Not his fault. 

Additionally, I’d like to point out the information seeking behaviors that I’ve noticed of loud Trump supporter in my Facebook feed. They tend to only believe Fox News. Personally, I don’t watch the news on TV anymore but I do sometimes keep their articles in my thread just to see how different sources are covering it. It’s been uncovered already that Fox News is propaganda. I notice that when they decide which parts to cover. Most headlines are talking about how Trump is trailing in the polls and Fox News chooses to say “this black man supports Trump” or something of the like. Fox News has been a key player in setting up this divisive stance. There’s a “you’re either with us or against us” belief that they’ve manifested, but it’s turned into more than that. Trump has made it all about him. If you’re a real American, you support him. If you don’t, then fuck you and get out. His supporters have adopted this rhetoric as well. Supporting Trump means you’re a God-fearing Christian and you love your country. Being a liberal means you want to take our guns, turn everyone gay, kill all the babies, and make us communists. 

Another reason in which Trump still has supports is the way people view reality. There’s an article from the Atlantic that describes their reality as climbing the hill of the “American dream”. I’ll link it here: [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/10/white-men-coronavirus-trump-approval/616780/)

I don’t want to pinpoint a lack of education as a player. Because that’s just a consequence of the underlying systemic issues. The US’s infrastructure was built on oppression by race, wealth, and status. It picks and chooses who’s on top and keeps people down on the bottom. Our capitalist state relies on sacrifice zones and wasted lives in order to thrive. We profit on prisons and coal mining towns. We repeatedly decide how much a life is worth. But that’s all another issue, isn’t it? 

It’s all fucked up and I’m scared too. Let’s just sit back and get drunk I guess.******The Republican Party has no platform and Trump voters are not weighing policy options. They’re voting for a narrative about themselves. Facts about Trump are meaninglessness, only the narrative matters.***Biden leads in the Rust belt states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. If he wins them and given trump won’t flip a single Hillary state, the election is over (although this would be a huge disappointment). I can see why your so mad, I’ve had enough of trump too. If you can please vote, as this nightmare could end January 20.***I agree on all fronts brother. I voted early and it's actually made my stress seem much less now. I figure that I did my part, it's all that I am able to do and now the rest is outside of my control. So tomorrow, wherever you are, whatever your doing, just sit back and know that whatever happens you did your part. Hopefully the country has learned from its mistakes and better minds have prospered.***I literally watched 3 and 1/2 minutes of election coverage this weekend and then swore it off until Wednesday.  I cannot watch it anymore hearing about ""Undecideds"" and ""Electoral Scenarios"".  It raises my anxiety to unmanageable levels.*** I have the same feelings you do. And what’s worse is that no matter who wins these hateful, anti science, anti intellectual, bigoted, racist Trump supporters will still be here. It’s a sad state of affairs.***I hear that, friend. I don't understand the country we live in at all. How is it possible for so many people to blindly drink the Flavor Aid?

I've done my part by voting. I wish I could do more by talking some sense into friends and relatives who are Trump supporters, but 1) I don't think sense would do any good, and 2) my blood pressure can't take it. Mainly the latter. I literally come away shaking with anger after hearing that moron talk, and his supporters are no better.******Is it a toss up? Possibly. It’s also potentially going to be a Biden blowout. I’d bet more on the latter than the former. 2020 is NOT 2016.***> I am actually devasted that this thing is a serious toss up.

Same but it helps to understand that in the US we have a very poor voting system and voting turnout is low -- something like 45% of voting age adults didn't even vote in the 2016 election. Between that and the fact that Trump lost the popular vote, we have a reality in which the POTUS was put in office by about ~62M voters, in a country with a population over 300M. 

So it isn't as if half of Americans like him, it is that nearly half of Americans are too complacent to even vote. Trump only had to be likable to half of the people that vote, and only to those in the places that like his type (anti abortion folks, racists, etc).***I've been getting nightly panic attacks about not doing enough to help in this election. I don't see how the US can handle another 4 years of this administration, and it boggles my mind how thoughtless people can be in not actively doing everything they can to oppose it. The attacks on democracy, climate change denial, worsening the pandemic, and resulting civil unrest if the election is unfairly contested are so dangerously clear. I don't understand how anyone could be unable to see that.***I am 34 and this year I have been dumbfounded by how many people just don’t get this. Tuesday and beyond has me nervous af. But, why is it this damn close?***Funny, not actually seeing a toss up. The MSM, is definitely trying to keep up the drama though. The turnout says it all, imo. Can see that and the drama play. So actually pretty calm about the blow out view. The drama side is pretty transparent as well, keeping up interest for ratings and to motivate people that haven’t already voted. One more day, and then I’ll be able to test my assessment.


How do I get one of those remind me notifications ?***Have you been volunteering? It might be helpful to channel that energy.***Completely understand and sympathize. First, walk off the ledge and vote. Then GOTV like our lives depend on it. Buy pizza for voters in line, do something to keep your mind off the worries. Exercise, take care of yourself and your loved ones. Donate to the dems to help pay for the inevitable lawsuits. Finally, read the Good News Roundup on Daily Kos. (https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2020/11/2/1991690/-Monday-Good-News-Roundup-On-the-eve-of-the-finale) It's been a blessing to me to have that daily dose of perspective and good positivity. Trump and his minions want you to be scared, they want you demoralized. Don't let them win.***I'm with you completely. I can't believe it's even close. It's almost like the worse he is, the more they like him. I honestly believe it's a mix of ignorance, hate and fear. Just shows you how gullible ppl are. He doesnt give af about anyone or anybody but himself and certainly not his supporters. I always just remind myself that no matter what happens, vote for vote, he is not supported by the majority. He wasnt in 2016 and it's hard to see him gaining millions outside of the RW news bubble over the last 4 years for 2020.  This has always given me hope. The majority of ppl in this country are good ppl.***Bro it's not gonna be close. You will see. But I'm sad I can't troll trump fans as much  after this. So many of them are gonna hide.***I'm not even American and I'm a nervous wreck.   Trump does impact the world (e.g. almost war with Iran, united nations, WHO etc.)

If you can't confirm whether or not your ballot was has been counted already, then you should go to your polling place and demand a provisional ballot.

By law, they can't refuse you. If your mail-in is later counted, the provisional ballot will be discarded. if the main-in isn't counted, the provisional ballot will be. You should also demand a receipt, and inform the election officials that both are required by law. Be polite and don't take no for an answer.

And please pass this message on.

I'm so goddamn exhausted.***Well, if we are venting...

I'm a liberal in fucking Alabama. And these brainwashed idiots consistently vote against their own self interests, because of wedge issues that have zero impact on their lives. They all want freedom and liberty, until there's something they disagree with. Then it's time to make it illegal.

I'm fucking sick of dealing with Y'all Qeada. My ass would be gone, if not for Covid. I've got a good job, and am near family. So until the world returns to normal, and the job market returns in my industry (which Trump supposedly have it's own week, yet provided zero funding or projects), I'm just gonna have to wait it out. 

But on a day like today, I can't help only think about 6 of George Carlin's 7 dirty words. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, and motherfucker. I don't think ""tits"" represents today, because tits are wonderful. But the other 6? Spot on.***Keep your head up.

Throw out anything he has or hasn't done so far(the list of his idiocy is long) and just focus in covid alone and you'll see how devastating and disillusioning it is that people voted for the guy who let this virus ravage our country, killing thousands of fellow Americans, infecting almost 10 millions people. Wrap your head around this, seriously think about 10 MILLION people infected and  ~241,000 dead. On 9/11 we lost 3000 brave Americans at the hands of an attack that we couldn't forsee. Now we lost 241,000 Americans, while the virus was known by Trump way earlier in the year.***I hear you. 
I’m freaking out over here. What if he actually wins??? I’m not sure what I will do. I may have to go silent for awhile.***I could listen to venting all day, so yeah, vent all you like. Trump has lessened my chances of becoming a permanent resident by the time I turn 21 (I have 7 yrs left) to 0.5%(approx.), when I have already been living in the US for 13 years. If Biden is elected, his administration could revote on a bill that wasn't passed in 2019 that would help my chances of staying.***Urban areas are where most of the jobs, educated people, educational institutions, diversity, multiculturalism, social acceptance for who you are, banking, finance, money, healthcare, art, music, culture, fashion, cuisine, sports teams, transportation, museums, architecture, landscaping, engineering, government centers, research, innovation.... You get the idea... It's where all actual life takes place. Even the actual commerce of the crops grown in rural areas is happening in the city. You live amongst other people, some like you, most very different and it works beautifully most of the time because everyone brings something different to the table. Teamwork makes the dreamwork. Yes there are some problems. But compared to....

Rural areas, or two-horse town, hilljack, cousin-fucking red counties as I like to call them, are food deserts, where the only place to get groceries or clothes is the Dollar General or a 2 hour drive to WalMart. Everyone knows your business and if you stand out at all you are ostracized by the other 50 people in your town. You have probably never been to the big city and probably never will because you're too scared. You can work at the aforementioned walmart or dollar general, casey's general store, the local prison, or if you're really lucky, a factory. You have a shit education from your one room schoolhouse. The xenophobic culture runs so deep that nobody from outside this incestuous petri dish of hate would ever want to move there from a city, not that you'd let them especially if their skin color is dark of all FUCKING THINGS. You feel like you're losing because you are. Just like your daddy lost in Vietnam and your grand pappy lost the civil war and that makes you angry so along comes Trump and suddenly you have a voice which unbeknownst to your simpleton ass is being exploited hard by a reality TV host for the power to stay out of court for tax evasion and God knows what other crimes...

The suburbs are a mix of this crap. Some commute to the city and the rest work in the suburb which is often only slightly better than deep Trump country. 

I sleep at night because when I read a fucking history book I understand a few things. Every time freedom and equality has been expanded to be more inclusive it has been a progressive platform that conservatives were dragged kicking and screaming toward. Slavery abolition. Voting rights for blacks. Voting rights for women. Gay marriage. Labor laws. On and on through history, actual freedoms that we now take for granted like entitled assholes, and are in real jeopardy of throwing away in 2 days, was fought for by pioneers. The ones against these ideas always lose. They always fucking lose eventually. So I hope that Trump has been just a dying gasp of longing for some kind ofade up nostalgic americana when America ""was great"" and will be again. But make no mistake, this orange fucking tyrant has and will continue to sell us out if we let him. Honestly, I think they relate to him because he is a loser.

Thank you for letting me vent.***It wouldn’t be a serious tossup but for the electoral college and all the GOP voter suppression shenanigans that have the blessing of the courts. Yes, a lot of people in this country are revealing their true colors. But more importantly, it is becoming clear that the political and legal systems we have in place allowed us to get here in the first place. That should’ve been clear after 2000, but now we know that was no fluke. We need to change our system of government so fundamentally that we may as well throw the whole thing out and start from scratch. We can’t have any illusions about this. First priority is to get the GOP out of power. Then the real work will begin.***Religion.  40 years of convincing people that if they don't fall lockstep behind the GOP that they are guilty of murdering babies is what has led us here.***For the people who thought their vote doesn't matter, the numbers right now say otherwise. It is so close. Popular and electoral. That 1.62 percent that voted for a third party could have swayed the election if they voted R or D. Im not dissing voting for a third party. I like the idea, but this was not the time to do it.***Same. And today I just feel like hammered shit. That's been burned on a George Forman grill.***I couldn't agree with you more.  I wish I could leave this planet.  The REALLY depressing thing about all of this is the complete disregard of the voters for Trump's ""legacy"" as an elected official ( I refuse to call him President.)  His refusal to deal with Covid has led to the death of over 200,000 Americans.  He doesn't give a shit.***One thing I have realized is that the United States is a very selfish nation.  The whole glamour of coming to the United States, pulling yourself by your own bootstraps and having the American dream, also has a dark side.  Its creates a lot of selfish people who don't really care about the nations underlying values.  They are ready to get rid of democracy so they achieve more power and more wealth.

My fear is the paramilitary groups such as police who will attempt to quell the population if trump tries to overthrow the election.  Plus I know the military generals are not overall happy with the president, but I can see elements in the military siding with Trump and enforce the overthrow of the democracy.

FYI, if Trump wins due to the Supreme Court overthrowing state election boards, then the United States will break apart or turn into an empire since now we have a dictatorship.  Al la Putin.  We are seeing the political equivalent of religious zealotry.***The answer is yes, you are that uneducated.  -Canadian shitting from the sidelines .***Let me ask you this.  If Trump ran as a Democrat and was anti-gun, and openly insulted conservatives.  And he ran against Ted Cruz, would you vote for Trump or Ted?***I thought you were talking about obama and biden until your named trump.***I can understand how you feel.  I feel the same way, only about Biden voters.

Only thing I can figure is that people only get one side and listen to stuff that supports their own thinking.  Anything that goes against it is “lies”.  We can’t even agree on basic facts anymore.

The media tells lies every night as if it is truth.  How can you be expected to avoid thinking what they say is true?

What we need is more critical thinking.  Challenge what you hear.  Make sure they are backing it up with hard facts, not opinions and hearsay.

A good example is the Russia collusion charge.  They never provided any facts to support it.  Yet many people still to this day believe it, even after it is been proven false.***That half of the country, isn’t crazy. I wish there was things I could say to help you. To at least bring you back to a more rational mentality over this. It shouldn’t be like this for anyone. I’ll be honest, I have the same feelings as you do towards people voting for Biden. All of them. 100% the same exact same ones. I’ll admit it for the sake of conversation. I’ve tried so hard to stand in a neutral position and look at the world to form my own opinions. I’ve done it multiple times, I was at a point where I wasn’t going to vote at all because of how trump handled covid. But as time went on and things happened on both sides, I can’t let myself not vote against the Democratic Party. They have flip flopped so hard it’s insane. Their hatred for Trump is insane. The media’s hatred for trump is insane. The forced politics down my throat at every turn in my life is insane. There was a point in time where fucking video games had politics involved. Those feelings I mentioned? That we both share? It stems from this. From the constant force feeding of politics. It’s not the soul reason but it’s one of the symptoms of this disease. I call it a disease for a lack of a better word, we shouldn’t feel this way it’s not normal. We should be able to talk this shit out, bring each other back to the middle. But for what ever reason, we either just flat out can’t do it, or something is stopping us. When I think about this neutrally, both sides have something to gain out of this. That leads me to believe something is deliberately stopping us. I know it sounds crazy, but look at some of the crazy shit our government has done, they have funded and armed entire countries and militaries, would be it be all that crazy to consider somebody or somebodies is playing all of us for fools?

I should preface by saying that if you are catholic and pro-choice, you are not catholic. You're something else. This is the realization I had while with the Jesuit school that changed my life trajectory.

I personally could not square that gay people are clearly the product of genetics and thus shunning them just doesn't calculate in my head. If God made man then God made gay people thus being gay is OK thus I can no longer believe the thing that says otherwise. So poof, no longer catholic and I left.

I was in the training to join the priesthood when Obama announced his candidacy. By the time I voted for him this realization had unpacked itself enough that I was in a full blown crisis by the time he won. I voted for him and knew I did the right thing in doing so but my entire identity was in question since if I wasn't catholic, and I had always been very catholic, then what was I?

2 years into his presidency I realized: I just cannot believe any religion. They do not jive with observable reality. God maybe is real. Abortion maybe is wrong. But the Bible is not what decides that.

So... Yes. You can be liberal and whatever else. You can be liberal and love guns. But you cannot be pro choice and catholic. It is an unambiguous rule by the literal vessel of gods word, the pope. And similarly if you don't think that the pope is a vessel through which god speaks then you're not catholic. You're a Christian or whatever you like. But not catholic.

Catholicism has a rule book, like Monopoly. If you start putting cash on free parking, you're playing a different (albeit similar) game.***I have a good friend who is Catholic and also an extremely educated, intelligent electrical engineer. 
I asked him once if science versus religion is ever an issue for him.

He replied that he often struggles with reconciling his religious beliefs with what science has taught him but that in the end he is able to believe in a god that prefers his morality (versus suppresive bible passages) no matter how it is obtained.

Are you talking about the religion (Catholic) or broadly interested and accepting of different tastes. I’ll assume you mean the religion. 

If your parents are conservative and has purposely chosen a conservative Catholic Church to attend, it might be hard for you to see how a liberal religious group works. If you think of people first over business and money, you sure can be a liberal Catholic. 

Some Catholic Churches will expect you to believe antigay and pro choice. Others will let you silently choose which beliefs or rejections are your way.

Leaders are not elected in a vacuum.

Their positions, personality, track record, and history are all important, but the *political context* around a candidate is a critical factor in determining the outcome of a *specific* election.

I voted for Obama twice. Among his other accomplishments, the ACA is one of the most important pieces of legislation of our time, and I don't regret my votes in the slightest. 

McCain was a great man who knew nothing about economics during an economic crisis. Romney was a psychopath. Neither were qualified to be president when they ran (or in Romney's case, ever).

I voted for Trump in 2016. He was a narcissist, a populist, and a failed businessman masquerading as a Republican. I knew all these things. I also knew he wouldn't get much of anything done except put at least one conservative on the Supreme Court, which he did.

There's a ton about Clinton's platform that I didn't want any part of, and I didn't want her replacing Scalia's seat. I'm more concerned about a left-leaning Supreme Court than I am one that is right-leaning. Also, I was really tired of the constant push for gun control during Obama's second term (which Hillary vowed to continue), and I wanted a break.

This election, I voted for Biden and made regular donations to his campaign (I would have voted for Hillary *this time* if she'd been the nominee). Biden has a few extreme positions, but I expect that the Senate will remain red, and I don't believe he'll be able to pass radical legislation during his term. He also won't be able to stack the court or swing it left, so I don't have to worry about them essentially legislating left-wing positions from the bench.

In contrast, Trump has become increasingly unhinged, he's dealing with a crisis he's totally unqualified to manage, and in his decaying mental state, he's made it clear that he's an immediate danger to our democracy and the world at large.

Different situation -> different vote -> different outcome

If Hillary ran in 2020, I absolutely believe she would have won for all the reasons I listed.

You're free to disagree with my values and core beliefs, but I'm a moderate who's never picked a losing presidential candidate (knock on wood 😋), so I hope my motivations provide some insight into Hillary's defeat and what people were thinking who opposed and supported your candidates 😊***>Was Hillary *really* that bad of a candidate? 

People want a woman in the White House so badly they tried to elect a criminal.   


Look, I get that Trump is an asshole, but neither she or Biden are really good either (the Iraq war.) 

I guess this time around people just wanted Trump out even if everyone realizes that Biden is neither a good candidate nor even really a left-wing politician.***Biden doesn't say scary shit like needing a new Manhattan project to undermine anonymity. Even though he'd probably agree behind closed doors***Hillary was really that bad of a candidate. 

Discounting Hillary herself, which was problematic, she had been openly villified by the right since early 1992 when she first became a lightning rod for right wing scorn. The democratic party seemed to be complely tone deaf to the massive amount of distrust and disdain  and derision for her that the republican party had sown over the two decades since she first arrived on the political scene, and embraced her as some golden knight that would sail to an easy victory.

She was, and will always be absolutely tone deaf to the people and completely unacceptable for a huge portion of the voters, and should be forever seen as way up the list of the most 'wrong candidate' ever promoted.

No. I don't feel insulted for Hillary, I felt insulted by the Democratic party and its blind illusion that she was right for the campaign. She may have been right for the office, but she was seriously unelectable. Look who she lost to.***It shows that Hillary was *just that bad* and that people hated trump *just that bad*.

Now I know that if you’re rich or even upper middle class, you don’t like to pay taxes. No one likes to pay taxes. But the government has a certain role to play when things need to get done quickly by organizations that don’t have to worry about financial risk. And that takes money.

In order for the two sides to come in the middle, we need to agree on the proper role of government. You can’t just say we shouldn’t have one. And we need to agree on really basic economic issues like “should rich people pay more taxes” and “should government intervene in market economies” and “should corporations be regulated at all”. 

My side says yes to all these things. And you have to admit it’s not really that outlandish to expect such things from a well run society.***One side wants to remove basic rights and choice from groups they don't like. This side actively shuns science and shuns working together for the health and safety of society.

The other side wants to provide basic rights and choice to all regardless of gender, race, religion, and orientation. This side supports science, and supports working together for the health and safety of society.

There is no middle ground here and there shouldn't be. The only good outcome is using education and information to help all individuals discern which side is worth supporting. This is unfortunately difficult when one side is also actively against education.***Hey buddy, fellow conservative here. I think Peter Boghossian gave a good answer to this. Instead of us trying to push our opinions, or seeing the bad on either side, we should try to understand the epistemology behind someone's position and beliefs. I think it would help all of us to seek understanding and not necessarily agreement or disagreement. This, I believe, would reduce the polarization in this country.***Honestly, try asking your own party these questions.  I think it’s more than fair to say the right-wing have completely gone off the rails.  As a matter of fact, your party is going to seat a known Q-Anon supporter In the House and have also sat a number of open racists in Congress.  Sorry, that kind of “difference” should never be accepted by anybody.***r/therewasanattempt***I’m with that.  I’ve been a politically active liberal my whole life, and I voted for Joe Biden, although I still see a path for either candidate as it stands right now.  And if Trump comes out on top when all is said and done, the one and only issue there on out should be what to do from there.  There’s no use in making a mess over it.  The only thing I would concern myself with is keeping politically active so that I can voice and and represent the ideals I stand for, even if the president does not share them.

I have never really withheld from talking and engaging with other people because they don’t share my politics.  In my opinion, allowing one’s understanding of opposing policies to be formed by people who don’t hold those policies is a recipe for misunderstanding and division.  I’ve always felt that it is infinitely easier to get through to someone about policies when you yourself hold and have shaped those policies in your mind and understand why you support them.  I’ve felt like it’s infinitely more constructive to be able to explain to someone precisely why I believe in my politics, and likewise to hear from people who hold beliefs different from my own why they hold them, rather than to hear it described on a surface level by someone who doesn’t themselves hold that view.***You know why liberals lose?

Elections have consequences. One consequence of this election is I've lost all respect for some of my soon-to-be former friends.***Sounds like they're the real cry babies***Im so disappointed in this being a close election at all. I was hoping for a huge blue wave in response to all thats happened this year. When there was a red wave after 9/11? At least that made sense. But why so red now? Was it simply in response to Obama? He wasn’t even that radical, is America just that racist? Im Asian and Im appalled to find out how many Asians voted for Trump. It just doesn’t make sense. I had a conversation with a coworker whos originally from the Philippines a couple days ago, she told me she was voting for Trump because she’s expecting the stimulus check from him. We both work at a grocery store and make minimum wage. And also, she has diabetes and in in remission from cancer. She should be retired, but she has to work to get medical coverage and to not be a burden to her son. How could someone like her ever think Trump is in her corner? Its not because of religion, she’s Catholic- Biden is Catholic! But someone decided Republican=godly, even someone as ungodly as Trump? People believe what they want sometimes, even to their own detriment. I just feel so powerless rn and I feel like Im being gaslighted. Why cant they see what theyre doing makes no sense.***It's been rough & this is all very serious. Still... I must thank you for the literal lol for the Santa bit. It turns out that sometimes laughter does help.***It's 1am in CO right now. I got about 4 hours of sleep last night then worked a 12hr day hungover. I stopped at Taco Bell on my way home tonight to try their grilled cheese burrito thing because I hadn't eaten all day. I hadn't had TB in probably 5 or 6 yrs. I don't know what that means, I was self medicating in some way I guess. Now I'm up binge watching ""Shitt$ Creek"". 
I feel cautiously optimistic about Biden but I'm so sad that almost half the country supports such a gross and hateful person like Trump. I'm *still* confused by 2016. I don't dislike Biden but he doesn't inspire me at all. If Kamala Harris happened to step into the presidency I wouldn't be too upset. I'm worried that I'm witnessing the decline of the US but I'm so glad in live in CO since we did well locally. 

Such a mixed bag of feelings. I'm emotionally worn out and ready for things to settle down. 4 yrs of crazy was enough.***I have been afraid even try to allow hope to enter my thoughts after election night. What I'm most upset about is Mitch the Bitch still being a Senator with majority power. He bragged that he prevented Obama from getting ANY judicial appointments confirmed in the last two years of his presidency. He'll just go on and do the same with Biden. I hate that mf-er worse than. i hate Trump, and that's saying something. Why is it ok for Republicans to get away with gaming the system year after year after year with NO repercussions? He, Lindsay, and Trump are just going to form a shadow government, banking on spending the next two years enflaming their rabid followers into acts of violence with the plan to recapture the House in two years by selling the ""Biden can't get Shit done (due to their blocking relief bills, stimulus, cabinet appointments) in an act of open rebellion and absolute malfeasance of the offices they hold. Fuck everyone in South Carolina who voted for Lindsay and double fuck everyone in Kentucky who voted for Moscow Mitch.***I do think they’re having an emotional reaction right now and are probably overly lashing out. Give them time to come down from the ledge. And keep being a nice person, bridging that gap. I know we have a lot of things we can agree with across the aisle, it’s going to take some time.***Wow. I would just have a stock response of “what would Jesus do?” For people like that. I’ve long been the democratic black sheep of my southern family and I usually just bring up religion since it’s supposedly so important to them.***all they have is hate***I feel a lot of distance right now with my Trump-loving relatives. He is their messiah and I want no relationship with them anymore. And it's my fault. It feels great.***Miami here holding up pretty well I just wish Arizona would just get it over with one way or the other, I'm not holding my breath that we will win Georgia but Georgia said they would be coming out with the total tonight so if for some reason Biden doesn't win Georgia I'm thinking Arizona and Nevada would probably be the last hope of him winning? Of all the news stations out there faux news called Arizona for Biden last night and I've heard that the drumpf team contacted them and asked them to open Arizona up again and the guy doing the polling for that station said no because what he saw in the voting pattern Biden is going to win Arizona.***They’re scared. Good. Ask them how it feels to be on the receiving side of their own attitudes.***So, I’ve distanced myself from of my Trump relatives but having a hard time with this election.  The older of my two younger brothers not only voted for Trump but also celebrated ACB’s Supreme Court seat.

Yet I'm also glad I'm not the only one 😎***at the end of the day they're less of a political party than a tribe, and instead of uniting around the ideals of democracy and a more perfect union that we (on paper) as a nation are striving for, they are falling back on easier and more reliable tropes of ethnic or religious identity  


I say on paper because to be fair, we were founded very far from our ideals on paper.  We enslaved one race and nearly killed the other one here before us, but for the last 200 years we have been making slow and steady progress, and that scares the shit out of them.

it sucks and I have no idea how to fix it***I am really starting to think we come up with a plan to split America, it might be time to dump the red states.***I'm good. Probably shouldn't be enjoying these republican meltdowns but... I am. Worse that Biden COULD still lose.

I think social media has made animals out of a certain block of people.  I don't say this lightly. I see Trump supporters as angry mobsters taking to the streets with long guns while Biden supporters take to the streets with petitions to sign.***Just fine really.

They dont' deserve our respect or recognition. The sooner we write them off and move on with our lives the better. Sure, they were brainwashed but they were already shitty people and all they needed was a little push to lash out at others. It's time for them to be marginalized, and unlike some 2016 voters, it is extremely unlikely that they're coming back from this after all that Trump has done to this country. Cut them off and get on with your life.***They believed a hate filled fairy tale. Their brains aren't wired for truth. I don't know how we can fight the next one.***Just had to add, I keep my Facebook around to keep in touch with relatives out of state, and oh man are the disinformation mills cranking it out overtime?***There's a lot of ""fallacy of composition"" errors going around nowadays. In this case, it seems like your neighbor suffers from it by assuming you are the ""crazy left"" they've heard about just because you voted Democrat and the democrats they probably hear about on their talk shows are crazy.

And, not to let liberals off the hook, I also see this fallacy when liberals think conservatives are racist because they always hear about racist conservatives... Or that all trump voters are intolerant because some neighbors and friends are intolerant.

It's valid to call it out but generalizations are very, very dangerous.***To play devils advocate, how would the left respond with a resounding Trump win? Probably similarly. We’re all so divisive right now, we need to come together around a common platform.

My entire in law family believes trump voters are being persecuted & are gods holy people. Its become a cult and i don't know how to undo that.***Take Don Lemon's advice and treat them like drug addicts. They have to hit ""bottom"" before they can change.***So I've had some mild success bridging the gap between myself and some family members that are Trump supporters. This is very broad advice but if you do want to have political conversations with them I wouldn't focus on telling them they are wrong, at least not off the bat. That will simply put them on the defensive and probably cause them to withdraw more.

I would really start by asking questions around their thoughts and concerns about politics and why that shapes their worldview. Try to find a common ground to establish trust, maybe they think everyone should have healthcare or whatever. It's more about asking questions so they feel that you're engaged and then when you present your views they may be more receptive. It's a process though.

In terms of the crazy news stuff, again I wouldn't bombard them with Politifact links telling them they are wrong. I tend to say things like ""I'm not sure if there is any evidence behind that, have you seen any?"" I think when you ask people questions like that often enough and with genuine intent they start to realize there isn't anything backing up what they are ingesting. To your point, you cannot directly convince them that this stuff is nonsense, they will slowly have to realize it themselves through discourse.***I gave up.

It would be impossible to argue about physics with Richard Feynman or Neil Degrasse Tyson because they just know everything there is to know about the subject. Try to prove them wrong and they’ll pull out hundreds of facts off the top of their head that proves they are.

That’s pretty much the same way with these people, except it’s all fake facts. By the time I’ve already disproved one they’ve got 5 more-and on the 1 in a hundred times they are right and I’m wrong I lose all credibility with them. They throw out so many conspiracy theories I’ve never even heard of-and you can’t argue things you don’t know anything about.***Hey, I feel this. Here's what I try:

1. Find the pool of shared meaning - I know someone who has been a huge Trump critic, but voted straight Republican because, ""Democrat's will raise taxes on the middle class"" to pay for corona relief.  As hard as it may be, I always try to find some common ground.  ""That's terrible,"" I'll say, ""the middle class is hurting too, I do not support raising taxes on the middle class""
2. Provide a safe space - I don't try to refute things right away.  Sharing a political idea is someone trying to be vulnerable, studies show that if someone is met with immediate resistance, it will only strengthen their view.  As stupid as it sounds, your parents are scared of the changing world (this is why people say Make America Great Again)  and the right wing media is feeding on that fear to push their agenda.  
3. Do your research -  Meanwhile, think about the position and try to come up with a response.  In the previous example, I did some research on [Modern Monetary Policy](https://www.marketplace.org/2019/01/24/modern-monetary-theory-explained/) which says, tldr, the government can print stimulus money, add it too the debt without raising taxes and the only consequence will be inflation.  However, because the economy is a little slow right now, printing money won't cause as much inflation as it would in a booming economy, so we can have stimulus money without raising taxes.
4.  Share the win - Remember, you are on their side.  This big scary thing that they are afraid of isn't true!  Reach out with your new found knowledge and say, ""I have good news, the government can send stimulus checks without raising taxes on the middle class! I even found this cute article with a cartoon, you should read it.""  The problem is that they don't have rational people to talk politics with in the first place.  Tell them that you like that you can talk politics with them, you probably know other families who can't handle small disagreements.  Tell them you care about them! You wouldn't be searching for advice if you didn't.
5. Rinse and repeat - In this example, I would continue thinking about ways to prevent raising taxes on the middle class.  I would reach out again and ask if they read the article and hey, by the way, what if we legalized and taxed marijuana?  Wouldn't that solve the problem too?  The government could divert resources  from the criminal justice system and prison complex and use that as stimulus funds.  Maybe there will be some left over to support American manufacturing and agriculture or whatever it is they care about.

Hang in there!***I'm going to follow this as I'm in the same boat. Not with parents because they're gone but my entire f'ing family has gone hard core Fox News and other right wing conspiracy outlets. Fact checking is unproductive.

I don't get it and I'm afraid they're just lost forever.*** [I found this article interesting](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-drawn-to-conspiracy-theories-share-a-cluster-of-psychological-features/) as it mentions that people with anxiety can be drawn to conspiratorial thinking. In my opinion, there are a number of factors at play that can lead to this other than anxiety, such as: loneliness, isolation, financial struggles, and when taken all together these lead to people becoming protective of themselves and paranoid. Good luck trying to free them of their delusions.***As a recovered conspiracy theorist, you can’t do anything. The problem with conspiracy theorists is they become a cult. Everybody else is wrong and there’s nothing you can do to change their mind. All of your efforts will only strengthen their position. For me, it took Sandy Hook to snap me out of it.***Ive had people leave their church because it ran counter to what Trump told them. They have made their choice.***Honestly, I don't think there's anything you can do outside of what you're already doing.  My mom and dad are on the Trump train, and they know not to bring up politics around me anymore.  In the past when they would bring up something defending Trump, I would just laugh in their face and tell them they need to lay off the FoxNews.  They haven't changed their views and they still watch FoxNews all day long, but they now know better than to talk that crazy shit to me.  So laughing in their face and not taking their claims seriously, along with me distancing myself from them these last couple years has helped change the way they behave around me, maybe it will help for your situation as well.

Summary: Laugh in their face and don't even give them the courtesy of a response or a fact-check when they're being bat shit crazy.  Also, distancing yourself from them will help get the point across that you don't support them being part of a cult.***It's a cult.

Ask them, If they are telling such bald faced lies to your face, why do you trust them?  

I had some luck with this approach recently.***There's a lot of information out there about how to counter conspiracy theories, but they all agree about two things: 

1. Facts and logic aren't useful, and 
2. It's really stinkin' hard to extinguish belief in a conspiracy theory. 

Here's one link I found with a quick search that seems interesting: https://theconversation.com/why-people-believe-in-conspiracy-theories-and-how-to-change-their-minds-82514

I don't have any answers, but I'm curious how your parents would respond to questions about *how* these things are happening? What mechanism is being used? How would those mechanisms be used? How do they get past the obstacles? How can they get away with it? If they're so good at doing these crazy things, how can this newsmax find out ""the truth?"" Wouldn't the conspirators have been able to block it? 

Or maybe make up an analogous conspiracy and explain it to them? Then, when they tell you all the reasons it can't be true, point out the parallels? 

Or maybe ignore the conspiracy theories they present, and counter them with undeniable facts: the village idiot is demanding vote counting stop, but only in states he thinks he'll win, while simultaneously demanding all votes be counted in states he's likely to lose? That's nonsensical on its face, so maybe they'll think a little more? 

Unlikely, though, and I'm sorry.***This is HG Welles’ “The War of the World’s” 1938 radio broadcast all over again, except we have had technology and a skewed media around long enough that we should know better.

Like instead of saying “that’s ridiculous and you’re and idiot for thinking that way” (not that you are saying that but it’s just an example) say “I can understand why you would think that but this is the evidence against that and logically this is more likely” words make a difference when talking about beliefs and politics so just try to be as respectful as possible and try to find sources they trust to find contradictions and also what’s true so that you have common ground when talking about it.

Time to move on.***It's not much, but check out r/QAnonCasualties.***Ask questions. Don't immediately say they're wrong or stupid or crazy. That'll only make them defensive and close down.

So, ask questions. Walk them through the conspiracy theory by asking logical questions. Keep your tone soft, light, genuine.

Almost like talking to a child to get them to fess up to something or understand something.

It's worked pretty well for me with my brother and dad. Whereas my mom's hate for Trump (her way of talking about him) includes getting emotional, loud and rude (sometimes downright mean) so they will not take anything she says seriously. They shut down. They're human, too.

Be patient, calm, and logical - if you really want to discuss things with Trumper family and not make them feel stupid/crazy/villains/etc like most people do.

Also researching the subject and having facts available helps to debunk their stories. They (right) hear one side, we (left) hear one side. Usually the answer is in the middle.

And remember, they spend way more time with these Fox/Newsmax/conspiracy theories and people who believe the way they do than they spend with you or any middle ground sources. They are inundated with people/things that reaffirm their beliefs.

So maybe go out for walks with them daily or every other day? Give them your attention and just hang out or watch a movie. Any time away from the propaganda is good...

Edits. Many, many edits. Everything I've suggested works for me when I'm talking online with right-wingers.

Us berating them will never change their minds. It's like being in an abusive relationship; no one can make you leave or see the light. All we can do is be there and encourage them to open their eyes. And it never happens overnight. If people aren't open minded they're not going to change their mindset just like that. Time"" patience and effort is required.***Just be kind and let them be nuts.

However, also gently stand your ground if they come at you with that stuff.  ""It's just not true, sorry."" Etc.***Posting to follow***""Escaping the Rabbit Hole: How to Debunk Conspiracy Theories using Facts, Logic and Respect"" by Mick West really helped me approach it better and settle my nerves about it.***Two books for you:

Their feelings are running the show right now, as they do for basically everybody. That's why your rational arguments don't go anywhere. You've got to get to a place of having genuine, safe emotional exchanges, and grow from there. Attacking their value system and beliefs directly may just mark you as someone who can't be trusted, which means you are unlikely to ever influence them.***My mom is doing that. My dad doesn't pay much attention to politics, but he should, because he's more of a critical thinker than my mom. He could help her. I live many thousands of miles from them and my very religious sibling by design. I can't think for another adult, and I won't go along with nonsense for the sake of a false relationship. I will avoid the deep end of the conversational pool to manage the infrequent call or visit and maintain a low-key peace with people I love but will never understand.***My mom told me this week that she can't trust any news network now. ABC, CBS or FOX. So....it's only a matter of time until she finds out about Newsmax. My mom was one of those thinking the caravans were coming for her in 2018. 

I have a feeling that things are only going to get worse. I'm hopeful, but I don't have a great feeling. Trump will probably start his own news network and feed this stuff.***Maybe when their SS and Medicare gets taken away just so that we can give more tax cuts to billionaires, then the light bulb will go off over their heads?

They might start to think a little more critically. Try starting an actual church of Trump and make some money while you’re at it.***Ye God's, I'm living with someone who is college educated, uc Berkeley, ucla law school,defense attorney, red diaper baby, from a notorious family of left wing writers, they all have government files and HE IS NUTS. Totally into this orange baboon. Is convinced of every conspiracy theory there is.  Trying to tell me they code hospital bills to get more money for covid. I'M A MEDICAL CLAIMS ADJUSTER!!!! HELLO!!!!  No, they dont. Yes they mention it,all depending on the other dxs. Geez it's like an underlying issue, if it doesn't kill you itself, it sure doesn't help!***I've abandoned two relationships with family members over their devotion to Alex Jones and conspiracy theories. After enduring that shit for years, it's actually been quite liberating. I should probably feel more anguish over dumping them but I don't. Maybe it's my inner sociopath, but I just had to quit giving a shit about their feelings....'cause they certainly didn't care about mine.***https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2020/11/06/police-probe-alleged-plot-to-attack-philly-vote-counting-center/amp/

Show them this***This just happened to me. Help.***Give it some time and hopefully they will eventually snap out of it.  In cults, when the cultists are separated from their leader for long periods of time, they eventually start coming to their senses.  I'm thinking the same is going to happen here, but it may take 6 months to a year, unfortunatly.***You could install blockers on all their browsers and devices. There's parental controls on most devices... we just never imagined we'd be using them on our parents.***I'm in the same boat unfortunately. If I find a way, I'll be sure to let you know.***My parents are Democrats, but I have friends and other family members like that. My solution is to always remain calm and respectful, but still point out when the facts are against them. Then every once in awhile I'll ask why they're so angry?

This last part is important, because the Republican strategy has long been to make people angry and get them to hate, which is bad on many levels for our society. My goal is to get them to ask themselves why they're angry and to figure this out for themselves. Just be sure to let them know that you'll always love them, regardless of their political views, because the opposite will only push them away.

P.S. I'm editing to mention an eye opening experience that I had recently. I'm a member of a forum that's not on reddit, where most of the other members are Trump supporters. They're in shock that Biden came back and won, but what really stood out to me is that many of them never thought Biden had a chance. I'm not sure what news services they use, but there were a lot of comments similar to ""No polls, or anything, were even giving Biden a shot, so how could he win?"" These comments were not making accusations of cheating, but were just honest questions. Now I'm wondering where they got their news, since Biden led in most of the legit polls. It's almost like they have their head in the sand, but without knowing it. So keep in mind that whatever has made them this way, it's likely because they're getting a very different story than the reality.***Fact checking will not work. My sister and her husband think the fact checkers were all ""paid off"". They will have to come to the realization on their own. Anything I tell them they just counter with rhetoric about how ""Al Gore was projected the winner"" and how ""courts ruled"" he lost.***Maybe try asking them to explain the conspiracies and the proof behind them? Don't argue, just ask them to explain. Ask about who's providing the evidence and for details about them. If there's no evidence, be surprised and ask why not. Things like that.

I don't think it'll work, but I don't know what else you can try.***The same thing is happening to my dad... I like to laugh at it to make myself less uncomfortable, but truthfully... it kind of hurts. It’s like he lost an integral part of himself. It feels like talking to a stranger sometimes***You can start simply limiting your contact time with them, eventually they will ask why.  Make up some reason why, or just say we can talk and see each other, but politics is off the table.  If they care about you, they will comply.  If not...***so they stopped watching fox news because it stepped out of their comfort zone? that is the most self centered thing i have ever heard, because the news organization doesnt really align with your thoughts and feelings makes it bad? holy shit i have no idea what to say...***give up***Yeah, don’t.***Just relax about it and ask the occasional question.  It’s better to let folks run out of steam than try to change their minds.  Politics are not at all worth hurting relationships***Cut off all contact and get in their face about it before you leave. Do not coddle the insanity. Tell them exactly why they are not welcome in your presence ever again.******Name an example of these conspiracies***How about saving people from the far left conspiracy theories***My favorite part of this was the ""unhinged from reality"" part.  

It reveals two aspects at once. 

You are implying that your parents have fallen victim to a dubious scheme and lost touch with fact based reality.

One would assume you the gatekeeper to that factory base reality.  The hinge base in a sense.

My question to you is what is your hinge base fastened onto?

If you say facts,  you must've realized that they are all made in a factory for people to fasten themselves to.  None of them are more important by nature than the other, and never before have they been less of consequence to the nature of reality itself than today.  

People believe what they want to believe, most of the time people believe what they are comfortable believing.  If you try to change your parents belief with fact, they will only become further detached because they will fail to truthfully engage in free conversation.  

I would say to have a chance of changing their opinion try to see their side of it and not judge them entirely based of off words claiming to be the gospel of fact.

It's like you are beating them over the head with them.  

Fact thumper!***I’m so glad they found Newsmax, FOX has opposed Trump for too long. Your parents aren’t unhinged, you need to listen to them.

joxe6z,"Same. 

Always offer the off ramp:

>When you’re ready to leave this behind, Ill be here. And I won’t tell you, ‘I told you so,’ I won’t be angry at you, I won’t accuse you of anything. 

>Ill just say, ‘welcome back home. I missed you’. 

It’s a tough thing to provide that off ramp, but they need to have it, or else they’ll never get off the bus flying over that cliff. 

Be firm, demand the apology that makes sense to you, but don’t keep them backed into a corner.

Edit:

A good apology requires five thing things:

1) explanation of what they did wrong. In detail. They must state what they are apologizing for. 

2) explanation of how they know what they did wrong was wrong. 

3) explanation of why they did the wrong. 

4) explanation of how they intend to make restitution. 

5) explanation of how they intend to make sure they never reoffend.***Wow, that's incredibly disheartening and sad. I'm sorry and I cant imagine the feelings you're processing. ❤***Please accept this warm hug from a progressive mom. You are the change that is this country's best hope.***She does know that Russia isn’t communist, right? It is run by a misogynist, homophobic megalomaniac who demands absolute loyalty, lies and bullies his way through when he is caught, and punishes anyone who opposes him. Wait.

Maybe you can tell her you love her, but that you're going to give her until after the era of Covid to chill. Hopefully the fever breaks. Hang in there.***I have not called or texted my folks for about two weeks because I can't listen to my mom tell me about her Trump support and various nutter talk that goes with that. She likes to start out by saying that she doesn't want to talk about politics, then she will declare Trump great and say the Dems don't do anything, and then she wants to change the subject because hearing me say I don't support Trump and I believe he is bad for the country isn't part of her plan.***OMG how awful, yeah I don't blame you for cutting your mother out.  Unless she comes to her senses and gets over her hateful and racist mindset, she doesn't deserve to have you in her life.  We shouldn't have to feel obligated to spend time with racist and hateful people.***Parental block FoxNews.***Holy shit, I feel for you. 
My mother in law is all about the NEW WORLD ORDER and the GREEN NEW DEAL as a means of ushering in the antichrist... but she doesn’t say the n-word. I’m sorry. You have support here.***Sending warm hugs. It's been hard the last few years. I've had different views from many people in my life, all throughout my life, and it's always been fine and we've always been able to tolerate our differences just fine... it's never caused so much anger and hostility and disruption as this last year or two has. This last few years under Trump has truly divided our country, to the point of lost friendships and family. It's been absolutely insane.***Maybe in a few years she'll understand how wrong she was and you can forgive her. Or not, it's a lot of ifs.***I pretty much lost mine to Qanon. The stuff they say is beyond bizaar. I tried to talk to them thinking I could change their mind and boy was I wrong. I was met with yelling and screaming. (The topic was blm)***I'm so sorry OP. It's such a hard thing, I don't know how to deal with it myself. 

My parents voted for trump in 2016 and we've been strained since then but now I've just learned they voted for him again in 2020. After everything that has happened. My mom posted a thing on her social media making light of republican protests (""we're supposed to be protesting, should I bring a casserole? Who's doing cookies?"") and I feel like it's the last straw. I've lost all respect for them. How can I ever see them the same way again? I don't want to cut them out but right now in this moment I want nothing to do with them. Ever again. It feels like my gut has been ripped out. I'm not handling it very well.***Once Biden is installed as President, the temperature will decrease.  YOU will have to now defend Biden, this may be a better outcome for you and Mom.  Don’t give up.***I think it's imperative we all realize the presidency impacts our daily lives very little. The most impact is from city, county and state, in that order. Get off the national narrative and onto local politics.

Our media is a shit show of fear and delusion, they've been sowing divisiveness for ages and it's not going to end. Find a local news agency to follow and stick to it. The democratic and republican parties are repugnant divisive groups that have the same goals, fill corporate pockets and sell your rights to the highest bidder. 

I'd fight to get her to a moderate view and not a R and D view, talk policy and local issues, not national ones that barely touch you. Getting people to this place is near impossible, but definitely worth the fight.***Wow! I'm so glad I got my mom to see my side and she voted for the FIRST time ever for Biden. However, she still has her negative ideas about BLM and Antifa. Now my stepdad and two of my brothers are definitely pro Trump. My stepdad is an asshole and knows it and he has NO FILTER whatsoever so he was sending me memes all the way up until the day of the election and making racist comments. I take him with a grain of salt but if I have to listen to him bitching everyday for the next four years, I'll lose it.***And this is why I say we need to make it as uncomfortable as possible for Trump supporters/voters.

jp0z1n,"Trump has been disparaging Fox in favor of OANN for years now  


It's partly because Fox isn't flattering enough for him, but probably mostly because he wants to start Trump News when he leaves office and usurp their delusional rightwing audience***It didn’t break the camels back, they’ll switch back to lapping up FOX news in a week. It’s just a tribal roar of rage at anything that dares upset their god figure. Primitive, but then again so is their attention span.***Actually it kind of scares me because while Fox is most certainly propaganda, it’s better than OANN or other bizarre far right sources you can find in the dark depths of the internet. Once they only consume that kind of content we are for sure fucked.

Edit: and by “we” I mean the country.***Those people who claim they don't want the government telling them what to do decided to turn against Fox when trump told them to.***Isn't it weird that there exists such things as Trump supporters?***I'm hoping the radical right splinters off and they won't be able to agree on who is radical enough and they will lose elections because of it. 

Meanwhile I want the left to become a little more progressive. Not sure what Biden will bring but it's fun sure better than what we have now. 

I am enjoying watching Trump flail.***I don't want Trump to win but mathematically they did call it way too early.***We all knew it was only a matter of time before those commie pinkoes at Fox News showed their true colors and backstabbed Trump and the Republicans.

Shame they had to be on the same network as the morning nuts and the 5 nuts and the evening nuts.***You know we fucked when Fox news is seen as to moderate for 95% of the right in this country***Not really surprised at all. Fox news will drop Trump here in a little while and start on Biden. This is what brings in ad revenue. If news outlets had to make money off of merely reporting the news, we'd be back to three news channels and news casts lasting about 30 minutes.***If you think about it, they were condemning the fact that their usual place to cherrypick the news to stay in their bubble didn't come through for them this one time. There is no principled stand or thought out position here. So no, I don't think it's weird. It's expected.***The Republican Fringe or Trump's base has been moving slightly away from Fox since Trump's rise - they are getting their news from Facebook. They've actually turned in on themselves and are feeding each other a spiral of bullshit a la Alex Jones. 

Some of it is due to disavowing the main stream media - so they do recognize a touch of their own potential hypocrisy when they tried to slam MSM then still support Fox.***It's a freaking cult! This is not normal. SICKENING.***Biting the hand that feeds you.***It was so redeeming to see that after everything we went through for the last twenty years.

Our politicans should be willing to shut everything down if they don't get policies that matter through. I'm talking defunding aid to states if we don't get Universal Healthcare and a fix for the tuition crisis followed by Universal Education. 

We need to agree right now that if Democrats hold the senate they are only ever going to hold hearings for left leaning Judges.

Absolutely.

I’ve searched for an article talking about that but unfortunately I’ve been unable to find one.

I’m guessing the reason they’re doing this is because Trump is not able to pardon someone unless they’ve been charged with a crime and no one will be charged with a crime until Trump is no longer able to pardon.

I’m not sure what the legal implications are for someone like Barr doing this in bad faith.  I hope it means the Bar Association disbars bar and invalidates the immunity since it was done under bad faith.

As a conservative, I posted something here very similar a few days ago and got absolutely shit on. 

The end of story is myself and many other conservatives are not “Trumpers” or trump supporters.

What did we get from our olive branches?

Uncontrolled pandemic.

Millions out of work.

Thousands of businesses, large and small, bankrupt.

Unaffordable healthcare.

Riots stoked by a president out of control.

Courts stacked for a lifetime.


It's not time to extend an 'olive branch'.  Meet the Republicans on the field and fight in the houses of Congress, fight in the state legislatures, fight in the White House and State Capitals.  

It may already be too late.  The Proud Boys are rattling their sabers.  But maybe if the battle is brought back to the political stage we can avoid a civil war.

What the hell happened with the polls this year?
Yes, the polls correctly predicted that Joe Biden would win the presidency. But they got all kinds of details, and a number of Senate races, badly wrong. FiveThirtyEight’s polling models projected that Biden would win Wisconsin by 8.3 points; with basically all the votes in, he won by a mere 0.63 percent, a miss of more than 7 points. In the Maine Senate race, FiveThirtyEight estimated that Democrat Sara Gideon would beat Republican incumbent Susan Collins by 2 points; Gideon lost by 9 points, an 11-point miss.
Biden’s lead was robust enough to hold even with this kind of polling error, but the leads of candidates like Gideon (or apparently, though it’s not officially called yet, Cal Cunningham in North Carolina) were not. Not all ballots have been counted yet, which could change polling-miss estimates, but a miss is already evident in states like Wisconsin and Maine where the votes are almost all in.
To try to make sense of the massive failure of polling this year, I reached out to the smartest polling guy I know: David Shor, an independent data analyst who’s a veteran of the Obama presidential campaigns who formerly operated a massive web-based survey at Civis Analytics before leaving earlier this year. He now works advising super PACs on ad testing. Since 2016, Shor’s been trying to sell me, and basically anyone else who’ll listen, on a particular theory of what went wrong in polling that year, and what he thinks went wrong with polling in 2018 and 2020, too.
The theory is that the kind of people who answer polls are systematically different from the kind of people who refuse to answer polls — and that this has recently begun biasing the polls in a systematic way.
This challenges a core premise of polling, which is that you can use the responses of poll takers to infer the views of the population at large — and that if there are differences between poll takers and non-poll takers, they can be statistically “controlled” for by weighting according to race, education, gender, and so forth. (Weighting increases and decreases the importance of responses from particular groups in a poll to better match their share of the actual population.) If these two groups do differ systematically, that means the results are biased.
The assumption that poll respondents and non-respondents are basically similar, once properly weighted, used to be roughly right — and then, starting in 2016, it became very, very wrong. People who don’t answer polls, Shor argues, tend to have low levels of trust in other people more generally. These low-trust folks used to vote similarly to everyone else. But as of 2016, they don’t: they tend to vote for Republicans.
Now, in 2020, Shor argues that the differences between poll respondents and non-respondents have gotten larger still. In part due to Covid-19 stir-craziness, Democrats, and particularly highly civically engaged Democrats who donate to and volunteer for campaigns, have become likelier to answer polls. It’s something to do when we’re all bored, and it feels civically useful. This biased the polls, Shor argues, in deep ways that even the best polls (including his own) struggled to account for.
Liberal Democrats answered more polls, so the polls overrepresented liberal Democrats and their views (even after weighting), and thus the polls gave Biden and Senate Democrats inflated odds of winning.
Shor and I talked on Zoom last Thursday about the 2020 polling miss, how he’s trying to prevent it from happening again (at least with his own survey), and why qualitative research is vulnerable to these same problems. A transcript, edited for length and clarity, follows.
Dylan Matthews
So, David: What the hell happened with the polls this year?
David Shor
So the basic story is that, particularly after Covid-19, Democrats got extremely excited, and had very high rates of engagement. They were donating at higher rates, etc., and this translated to them also taking surveys, because they were locked at home and didn’t have anything else to do. There’s some pretty clear evidence that that’s nearly all of it: It was partisan non-response. Democrats just started taking a bunch of surveys [when they were called by pollsters, while Republicans did not].
Just to put some numbers on that, if you look at the early vote results, and compare it with the crosstabs of what public polls said early voters were going to be, it’s pretty clear that early voters were considerably less Democratic than people thought. Campaign pollsters can actually join survey takers to voter files, and starting in March, the percentage of our survey takers who were, say, ActBlue donors skyrocketed. The average social trust of respondents went up, core attitudes changed — basically, liberals just started taking surveys at really high rates. That’s what happened.
Dylan Matthews
You mentioned social trust. Walk me through your basic theory about how people who agree to take surveys have higher levels of social trust, and how that has biased the polls in recent years.
David Shor
For three cycles in a row, there’s been this consistent pattern of pollsters overestimating Democratic support in some states and underestimating support in other states. This has been pretty consistent. It happened in 2018. It happened in 2020. And the reason that’s happening is because the way that [pollsters] are doing polling right now just doesn’t work.***The way they do statewide polling now is over. It's over forever. Don't make a correction next time and then 2022 or 2024 they'll tell us they fixed it but the same thing will happen.***Part II

Poll Twitter tends to ascribe these mystical powers to these different pollsters. But they’re all doing very similar things. Fundamentally, every “high-quality public pollster” does random digit dialing. They call a bunch of random numbers, roughly 1 percent of people pick up the phone, and then they ask stuff like education, and age, and race, and gender, sometimes household size. And then they weight it up to the census, because the census says how many adults do all of those things. That works if people who answer surveys are the same as people who don’t, once you control for age and race and gender and all this other stuff.
But it turns out that people who answer surveys are really weird. They’re considerably more politically engaged than normal. I put in a five-factor test [a kind of personality survey] and they have much higher agreeableness [a measure of how cooperative and warm people are], which makes sense, if you think about literally what’s happening.
They also have higher levels of social trust. I use the General Social Survey’s question, which is, “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?” The way the GSS works is they hire tons of people to go get in-person responses. They get a 70 percent response rate. We can basically believe what they say.
It turns out, in the GSS, that 70 percent of people say that people can’t be trusted. And if you do phone surveys, and you weight, you will get that 50 percent of people say that people can be trusted. It’s a pretty massive gap. [Sociologist] Robert Putnam actually did some research on this, but people who don’t trust people and don’t trust institutions are way less likely to answer phone surveys. Unsurprising! This has always been true. It just used to not matter.
It used to be that once you control for age and race and gender and education, that people who trusted their neighbors basically voted the same as people who didn’t trust their neighbors. But then, starting in 2016, suddenly that shifted. If you look at white people without college education, high-trust non-college whites tended toward [Democrats], and low-trust non-college whites heavily turned against us. In 2016, we were polling this high-trust electorate, so we overestimated Clinton. These low-trust people still vote, even if they’re not answering these phone surveys.
Dylan Matthews
So that’s 2016. Same story in 2018 and 2020?
David Shor
The same biases happened again in 2018, which people didn’t notice because Democrats won anyway. What’s different about this cycle is that in 2016 and 2018, the national polls were basically right. This time, we’ll see when all the ballots get counted, but the national polls were pretty wrong. If you look at why, I think the answer is related, which is that people who answer phone surveys are considerably more politically engaged than the overall population.
If you match to vote history, literally 95 percent of people who answer phone surveys vote. That’s the problem with “likely voter screens” [which try to improve polls by limiting them to the likeliest respondents to vote]. If you restrict to people who have never voted in an election before, 70 percent of phone survey takers vote. If you restrict to people who say they will definitely not vote, 76 percent of those people vote.
Normally that doesn’t matter, because political engagement is actually not super correlated with partisanship. That is normally true, and if it wasn’t, polling would totally break. In 2020, they broke. There were very, very high levels of political engagement by liberals during Covid. You can see in the data it really happened around March. Democrats’ public Senate polling started surging in March. Liberals were cooped up, because of Covid, and so they started answering surveys more and being more engaged.
This gets to something that’s really scary about polling, which is that polling is fundamentally built on this assumption that people who answer surveys are the same as people who don’t, once you condition on enough things. That can be true at any given time. But these things that we’re trying to measure are constantly changing. And so you can have a method that worked in past cycles suddenly break.
Dylan Matthews
Why can’t you just fix that by weighting? Why not just control the results by sexual orientation or religion to get around that problem?
David Shor
You can know from the GSS, say, how many people nationwide have low levels of social trust. But that doesn’t tell you — what about likely voters? Or what about likely voters in Ohio’s 13th Congressional District? How does that break out by race or gender or education? How does that interact with turnout? All that stuff becomes quite hard.
There’s a reason pollsters don’t weight by everything. Say you have 800 responses. The more variables you weight by, the lower your effective sample size is. Once the number of things you control for increases past a certain point, traditional techniques start to fail and you need to start doing machine learning and modeling.
This is the bigger point about the industry I’m trying to make. There used to be a world where polling involved calling people, applying classical statistical adjustments, and putting most of the emphasis on interpretation. Now you need voter files and proprietary first-party data and teams of machine learning engineers. It’s become a much harder problem.
Dylan Matthews
One reaction I’ve seen from several quarters is that 2020 shows that quantitative methods aren’t enough to understand the electorate, and pollsters need to do more to incorporate ethnographic techniques, deep interviews, etc. In a way, you’re proposing the opposite: Pollsters need to get way more sophisticated in their quantitative methods to overcome the biases that wrecked the polls this year. Am I understanding that right?
David Shor
I mean, I’m not a robot. Qualitative research and interpretation are important for winning elections. But I think it’s a misunderstanding of why polls were wrong.
A lot of people think that the reason why polls were wrong was because of “shy Trump voters.” You talk to someone, they say they’re undecided, or they say they’re gonna vote for Biden, but it wasn’t real. Then, maybe if you had a focus group, they’d say, “I’m voting for Biden, but I don’t know.” And then your ethnographer could read the uncertainty and decide, “Okay, this isn’t really a firm Biden voter.” That kind of thing is very trendy as an explanation.
But it’s not why the polls were wrong. It just isn’t. People tell the truth, when you ask them who they’re voting for. They really do, on average. The reason why the polls are wrong is because the people who were answering these surveys were the wrong people. If you do your ethnographic research, if you try to recruit these focus groups, you’re going to have the same biases. They recruit focus groups by calling people! Survey takers are weird. People in focus groups are even weirder. Qualitative research doesn’t solve the problem of one group of people being really, really excited to share their opinions, while another group Isn’t. As long as that bias exists, it’ll percolate down to whatever you do.***More than that, the people who DONT answer polls vote and are unrepresented. 

It's not that they are shy or that they are ashamed. They just dont trust giving out personal information. So they dont participate.***Btw. I have FB ""friends"" on the Republican side and several of them said they were polled and purposely said they were for Biden just to fuck over the polls. Then I see this on random Trumpster social media posts.
Btw, as a Liberal, I Never get polled (only a cell phone user). 
So conservatives get polled but lie and I never get polled. Wtf??***Same logic Trump lost by mail-in ballots; mistrust.

If Trump says the polls are phony for 4 years, then why would his supporters answer them?***At this point I’m pretty sure polls are designed only to increase Republican turnout.***The questionaires that are in polls are too big. They take way too long for regular people to answer. 

They also as OP said, attract weirdos.

I've seen scientific surveys ... why? Because I was trained how to create them as part of earning my grad degree. They're bloated with questions to ""eliminate bias"" - but, as part of that ... they get to the point where - if someone asked ME to fill out a survey for 10, 15, 20 minutes - and all I got for it was a couple points to spend on a magazine subscription ... PFF, yeah right.

By that - they've eliminated probably 50% of the population.

Then there's the problem of true sampling. How can they do it right? True, totally random sampling ... which is expensive.

Then if the true intend of the survey is revealed ; what happens? It becomes biased.

I have ideas for how to ""bypass"" the bias ; but - political surveying is not my primary field. I do other types of research. I'll leave that work to those best suited to it.***To be honest, I think it's simpler than that.

Most people have a moral conscience, they know what the 'right thing to do' is.  However, many then  go on to ignore that moral conscience and do what they feel they want, be it racist, misogynistic or just plain selfish. This is what they want and that's how they'll vote.

However, when someone asks how they'll vote, especially in public or a pollster they allow their moral conscience to take ascendancy and ... lie.***I thought I heard Trump tell his supporters to lie to pollsters so the Dems think they have a huge lead or something. 

He said something like, this being part of his silent majority maybe? 

I dunno, I hear that guy say a lot of shit.***There were Trump people deliberately lying about voting for Biden and they were told to do this to suppress the vote.***I LOVE answering political surveys, and really surveys of any kind.  I'll go out of my way to do one - even answer the landline on the chance that ""SPAM'"" call is a poll.

He's pretty cringe sometimes, but I have to give him credit on this one.***It's one thing when we are using polling to predict elections. But it's an entirely different problem when we are using polling to build a party platform.  

For example, sales data, background check data, FOID application data, concealed carry licensing data, marketing data, and **all** hard, verifiable data on the subject indicates that gun ownership rates are climbing rapidly.  Polling data says that ownership rates are falling. 

If we trust the polling data over the hard data in deciding our positions, this plank in our platform will run contrary to the views of the electorate.***So maybe they need to pay people to respond? I can see this as a serious issue with polling. Also maybe poll their beliefs instead of who they’re voting for. I do think a lot of trump voters lied.

jrqikd,"I only know two reasons, conservatives think that unions protect the lazy and punish the employer, neither of which are the case. If one lazy worker has a job alongside several dozen good employees who are also protected from shit corporations, then it isn't a bad thing. The employer wouldn't pay their employees if the law didn't make them, that's why there are many hard jobs offering 13, a non-livable wage in most US cities. 

Some unions are a bit useless imo. I used to work for the DOC, and their union was to protect officers from losing their jobs. It is almost impossible to lose your job as a correctional officer in my state unless you screw around with an offender or bring in contraband. Even the asshole who pepper sprayed a Muslim prayer room still has his job.***I bet they like Cop Unions.***Republicans try to shift the blame of companies moving manufacturing overseas on unions. When in reality, companies moved as soon as developing countries built the required infrastructure need to perform large manufacturing and shipping. Combine that with free trade deals with countries with significantly lower pay rates, and nothing would've stopped job losses in that sector.***Maybe I can help shed some light on this. Below are some common ideas floated around that are anti-union:

1. Unions are anathema to the free market; they set a ""price floor"" on labor instead of allowing the market determine the price of labor. Somebody who believes in the free market would argue that this results in a suboptimal allocation of resources, causing market inefficiencies. 

2. Unions are the reason so much of the manufacturing industry has been shipped overseas. By forcing wages to be higher, unions have made it comparatively cheaper to ship jobs overseas. People who say this believe that unions in effect are cutting off the working class' nose to spite its face. 

3. Unions protect lazy workers. This has already been talked about by others. 

4. Unions had their time and their place, but that time and place is now gone. Union power peaked roughly in the 1970s; at that point, many powerful unions became politically involved and engaged in all the shit slinging therein. Also, some unions got tied up with the mob, which left a pretty bad taste in people's mouths. 

I'm personally not a big fan of unions; there's at least an inkling of truth to each of the points above. Unions in America need a significant overhaul in order to survive.***Sounds like a unique and personal perspective you are applying to wide spectrum of people.",0.029457143,0.28813354,0.536780718,Neutral,"Question about Unions and the ""made in America"" debacle",reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/jrqikd/question_about_unions_and_the_made_in_america/,11/10/2020,question unions `` made america '' debacle

If any state deviates from that method, they have to notify voters in writing well ahead of the election.

No state has done this. Drumpf has no path to victory.***It wasn’t surprising me to that GA flipped. I grew up in Atlanta, saw a lot of diversity, saw a lot of young people and families moving to Atlanta especially for job opportunities and lower cost of living than northeastern big cities.

Living in PA lol. Same here. PA is still counting in bigger counties. Recount maybe, but it’s not going to make 40k new votes magically appear. 

Trump and his supporters are grasping at straws. They’re delusional. The thing is, that they’re also dangerous. I’ve noticed Americans have a lot of faith in their political system and they honestly wave away what Trump does like “eh he can’t do that”. And then he does it and nobody holds him accountable. For him to go around suing states with no proof, that’s dangerous. All he needs is one judge that is heavy Pro-Trump.***Even if GA and AZ go to him, he can't win without PA and he won't win PA because he would need evidence to throw out 50,000 votes and the only way that can happen is illegally.

Arizona is a long shot, but he could still squeak out a victory there. 

Basically, it looks like he has no shot to win based on votes. His only path to victory is through the courts or manipulating the electoral college.

- Conservative culture only works if every individual is in lockstep compliance with norms. For example, traditional male and female gender gender roles only work if everyone adheres to those and gets married in a traditional way. Otherwise, individuals learn only half the skills they need to be a functional adult, and will have a hard time if they don’t find a partner to compensate for their gaps.

- Their ideology is faith-based, not evidence-based. In practice that means salesmanship of one’s ideas is far more potent than any amount of evidence, making adherents inherently more gullible and easy to deceive.

- Conservatives are looking for set it and forget it governance that they don’t have to think about. Unfortunately in practice that is impossible, as people in power will always have a vested interest in understanding how to manipulate the less powerful. It is not realistic to expect an unsupervised government to not become corrupt over time.

- Along with the last board, conservatives are conditioned to receive knowledge, not to seek it out or question it. They expect other people to do the thinking for them.***Buy guns and train with them***Reports yesterday said Donald Junior is trying to take over the GOP if that happens it will collapse.***Given that the orange fucking clown go more than 70 million votes, the Grand Old Pussies are going to live in fear of a mean tweet for the next 4 years.***The Republicans are about to do what democrats did after 2016- rebranding and moving on after trump assuming trump shuts the fuck up and goes away.

---

It’s becoming clear that President Trump’s firing of Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper by tweet Monday was only the first step in an effort to remove the entire top Defense Department leadership team and replace it with officials loyal to the president. As more and more senior Pentagon officials lose their jobs, all eyes are on Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley, who has fallen out of favor with many inside the White House.

On Tuesday, the purge widened dramatically as the White House asked for the resignations of three more top Pentagon officials: Undersecretary of Defense for Policy John Anderson, Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Joseph Kernan and Pentagon Chief of Staff Jen Stewart. All three are being replaced by staffers more loyal to Trump’s political agenda. Officials said Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist could be the next White House target for dismissal.

These are major shake-ups. But getting rid of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs would be an earthquake. Milley has no intention to resign, several officials told me, adding that Trump has made no decision yet to call for his resignation. Other senior officials who refused to resign, such as USAID deputy administrator Bonnie Glick, have been terminated with no explanation.

Like Esper, Milley has run afoul of a faction of top Trump aides who are purging officials all over the government. Milley sided with Esper internally on the issue of Confederate symbols on military bases, which both support removing, breaking with Trump. Milley also disagrees with some White House officials who want to precipitously withdraw from Afghanistan and Syria. The New York Times reported in June that Milley had angered Trump by disagreeing with him twice to his face, once about using active-duty troops to quash protesters and once about Trump’s order to use chemical agents on protesters during the president’s notorious Lafayette Square photo op. Milley and Esper ultimately decided to accompany Trump on his walk across the square.

“I should not have been there,” Milley said in a National Defense University video a few days later. “My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.”

Milley would be harder to fire than Esper. He was confirmed by the Senate for a four-year term as chairman in 2019 by a vote of 89 to 1. Replacing him with a political loyalist would be difficult because the Joint Chiefs chairman position has specific requirements, including that it must be filled by a senior military commander (although Trump could exert a waiver). Milley has also worked to stay in Trump’s personal good graces, more successfully than Esper. But officials warned that might not stop the White House officials who want him gone.

Meanwhile, MAGA loyalists are moving in to take advantage of the vacancies already created. Anderson’s sudden departure leaves the Pentagon’s policy shop in the hands of Anthony Tata, a Trump loyalist who once called President Barack Obama a “terrorist leader.” Tata withdrew his previous nomination in August for the undersecretary job amid criticism from lawmakers about his past statements and lack of qualifications. He has been serving since then as an “official performing the duties of the deputy undersecretary of defense for policy,” a Pentagon statement said.

As for Kernan, officials told me the White House intends to install staunch Trump loyalist Ezra Cohen-Watnick as acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence. Cohen-Watnick, who was pushed out as senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council by H.R. McMaster in 2017, has been serving as the Pentagon’s deputy assistant secretary of defense for counternarcotics and global threats since May. Stewart is reportedly being replaced by Kash Patel, an NSC staffer who previously worked for Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).

Trump passed over Norquist on Monday to appoint Christopher C. Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, to the acting defense secretary position. Miller, a former Special Forces officer, is seen as more loyal to the political agenda of the president. Democratic lawmakers are already calling on him to follow the rule of law and the Constitution if Trump asks him to intervene in the election or the transition.

Several officials told me that a group of Trump loyalists is seizing the opportunity to purge the Pentagon (and several other agencies) largely without close supervision from the president, who remains focused on fighting the outcome of the election. By installing themselves in top jobs, these officials are stalling the transition, settling scores and advancing their own ambitions. Many officials in the agencies they are taking over are also now wondering whether the loyalists’ plan includes helping Trump resist leaving office.

Trump’s decision to jettison Esper only days after the election was a long time coming, and it wasn’t just about Esper’s opposition to using active duty troops against protesters in June, as many have reported. Esper also broke with Trump on the Confederate symbols issue, failed to offer full-throated support when Trump pardoned a soldier convicted of war crimes, and committed various other perceived acts of disloyalty.

What’s odd is that Trump mocked Esper for being too soft, repeating that some call him “Yesper,” which seems to indicate Esper was too loyal to Trump. In his exit interview with the Military Times, which he gave on Nov. 4 because he knew what was coming, Esper insisted he was not a “yes man” because he didn’t lavish effusive praise on Trump, like other senior officials.

But that doesn’t capture the whole complicated reality, since Esper also took actions aimed at demonstrating his loyalty to the president (such as defending Trump’s troop withdrawals and efforts to extort allies in public). He was trying to please everybody and failed to satisfy anyone. That position was ultimately untenable.

The moment of truth will come if and when the General Services Administration certifies that Joe Biden won the election, making it the law of the land. Trump may order his officials not to comply. That could force every senior official, including Milley, to choose between following the law or staying loyal to the president.

If such a development comes to pass, the continuing crisis atop the Pentagon and across the government would reach a new and dangerous level, leaving our country during this fraught transition even more unstable and unsafe than it has already become.***I think they're trying to bury evidence.***The President can easily fire the joint chiefs of staff and likely could use a waiver to immediately install whomever he chooses. The problem ultimately though is that on Jan 20th at 12PM EST the new commander in chief takes over and can then make whatever changes he wants to make.***Jan is going to be a weird dark month.***Why would the union army have even one of the traitors that stood against them memorialized on a military installation?***They are all civilians, however, not the military.

Wow. What a coincidence.***How can it be if trump lost? He's a winner, he can't literally lose.***And yet we are still going to have people completely disregarding these statements and accepting that millions of votes were changed. Gods do we need the fairness doctrine back so we can sue these people into the ground. The stupid loophole where you report some thing someone said and then can just blast it all over the internet like you’re a reliable news source needs to be done away with. The number of articles that I have filtered through touting election fraud in some manner that fall apart the second you click through to their “sources” is absolutely asinine. These are official agencies under the DHS, one of which that was actually signed into existence by Trump. This should be the only line we need.***Full statement:

“The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result.

When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors. **There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.**

Other security measures like pre-election testing, state certification of voting equipment, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) certification of voting equipment help to build additional confidence in the voting systems used in 2020.

While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too. When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections.”***Those reading this, please please please consider donating to the special election happening in GA with Jon Ossof and Raphael Warnock.

juqucl,"My goodness. 

First off, let me say I am extremely impressed by your commitment to that project and the obvious love you have for your father to try and make this work. 

I don’t know the answer to the “when do I throw in the towel question” but I’m thinking your dad mayyyyy run out of acceptable (shared) resources as you weed out the Breitbarts and the Blaze type of media of that world? Maybe he will need to gravitate toward more mainstream sources. I’m sure that was your thinking, but it may need more time.

I am in the exact same situation with my husband, so I truly feel your pain and have been through this exact scenario many times. What was missing for us was the framework you devised to try to keep things from getting heated. We also argue about misinformation and verifiably false talking points and it drives me nuts.

In our house, we now avoid all political discussions and it makes me really sad. I would like to try your method, so maybe you could post an update sometime to let us know how things are going. 

I wish you the best of luck and can only say you might want to stick with it a little while longer. The effort you’ve put in might pay off, given that your dad is still engaged, (though misguided) and that would definitely be worth it.***Full credit to you for tackling this. That's a lot of work and effort.

The problem you're facing is that misinformation often takes facts or statements made and either intentionally misses the context of combines them in nonsensical ways to create a new, erroneous, narrative. That's the crux of the adage ""A lie can get around the world before the truth has got it's boots on"". The second problem you're facing is your dad has not stopped watching the propaganda, and even knowing some isn't credible he'll likely continue to believe it in the face of all evidence.

It also means you're doing a job of a fact checker, which is time consuming and difficult. If you're going to continue doing this I suggest you line up websites that specifically debunk claims made: politifact, snopes, etc. You'll have the benefit of their analysis and the go back to source material for context, assuming there is any. Search for each claim made and debunk it. It's an order of magnitude more work than the person who created the lie had to do in the first place, but that's why they created that lie.***You need to put more structure in place. You’re identifying topics and then going off to find information. Before you do that, agree to the topic and also agree to the question(s) you’re trying to answer. 

If your Dad told you the election was stolen, your first response should be to ask what we would need to know to determine that an election was stolen. Turn the discussion towards structuring the argument. 

How would I know if an election was stolen? I would need to know:
-how votes are counted
-who is present when votes are counted
-etc. etc

With most topics you find out pretty quickly that you actually have limited relevant knowledge, even for things that feel familiar like an election. 

Choose a topic, ask what it is you’re trying to answer about that topic, and then ask what you would need to know in order to determine the answer.

Get him to agree to answering specific questions first, then begin the research. 

Example: The Republican Party’s conflict with Science.

Question: Does the Republican Party disregard science?

What would I need to know to answer that?

How do other countries and governments leverage science to fight Covid? What’s the baseline? 

Who are scientific organizations or individuals that could/should be relied on to fight pandemics? What were the GOP’s interactions with those groups/people?

What scientific principles or practices related to pandemics existed prior to COVID-19? What did Bush or Obama have in place? Were those valid? Did the GOP stick with them? Alter? Ignore?

Describe the GOPs COVID strategy. What was the strategy designed to achieve? Is that in line with science goals or economic goals or other goals?

This is true for any research or debate topic. Define the questions to answer and then ask “What would I need to know to answer that?” Get agreement that you have logically structured the argument BEFORE you begin research.***I’ve got a very similar story. The problem is likely your father’s daily environment. If he agrees and then goes home and watches fox news for a month: of course he’s going to revert.***First, as someone whose parents are surface-level similar to yours (well-educated, fairly decent people who I believe care about me and society in general, yet make their decisions based on ""the Spirit led me""), I'm sorry for the pain his unwillingness to face reality has caused you.

Second, after discovering that my folks were not reading much more than the headlines on even their own sources while I was reading/evaluating both my own sources and theirs in each debate we had, I've given up on debating them.

Your first instinct (""Let's have a surface level, polite relationship"") is what I have found works with my parents. Anything more is just giving them a soapbox on which to rant nonsense.***I'm going the other way here from others and say you are wasting your time.  Your father has found what he is  comfortable with and he genuinely believes in it.  I think you are making an assumption that your father suggested these ""debates"" because he thinks that maybe he's wrong.  Maybe you brought up some point that he has no answer for and he's ready to be educated.   It's exactly the opposite.  He honestly believes that this is just another lesson for you from him.   There is exactly the same amount of chance that you are going to change his mind, as he changes yours.

I hope it's good for you both, that this debate brings you guys back together.   However if it doesn't, if it turns into nothing but frustration and bitterness you have a decision to make.  Is talking politics more important to you than a relationship with your Father?    There is a simple solution, that can fix a lot of this.  Get together with everyone that you do family events with and ban politics as a discussion.  No exceptions.   Right now is a great time for you to do this, because Trump no longer holds any government position.  

Remember.  Yeah politics are important, but neither of you has any impact at all on policy and actions of the government.  Working yourself up, blaming your father, because he supports an idiot, isn't very productive.***There are some pretty good documentaries about Trump on Amazon prime & Netflix. 

There's a lot of material about this guy & he truly is, thankfully, one of a kind. 

After watching these docs, I came away with simply - he hurts everyone. And those who love him most, he hurts the worst. 

Just look at Michael Cohen. He was faithful and was crushed and discarded after no longer being useful. The guy still pines for the good old days at Yankees games. But then he snaps right back. 

It took Mr. Cohen the better part of two decades to be free of the delusion. 

Have patience with loved ones, this scar is going to take awhile to heal.***Accept him as he is or cut him loose. He's not going to change because you want him to and he's not going to hear one of your arguments and suddenly realize his whole worldview is warped. This is your reality. Good luck.***TL;DR Political thinking/reaction/position may be more of a bottom up instead of top down cognitive function. Rather than a nuanced rational argument, the first thing to do may be to convince the person you aren’t a tiger. And that in fact there are no tigers here.

[Edit: I wanted to add that I’m sorry you’re going through this, I know how painful it can be. And seriously a pat on the back for trying as hard as you have. For real. If I can add a more practical suggestion than the below stuff: Because of the reasons discussed below, the best way forward may be to realign your relating with one another by doing so in a different context and subject matter. If you have some common ground on some other topic or hobby try and stay on that for a while instead.]

I’d like to offer a slightly different perspective. Having observed U.S. politics for the last 30-ish years, reason and facts have very little to do with what political ground a person comes to stand on. I think many liberals (myself included) might protest that they hold their beliefs because they listen to facts, are open minded, and value empathy and cooperation. But I think we often choose that path or way of thinking because of root factors in our life.

I had previously looked to George Lakoff to get some kind of understanding of why people were seemingly acting against their own best interests and why reason and accurate information were ineffective at influencing people’s politics.

I think there is a lot of value there and is still especially useful in considering modes and message of communicating politically.

But recently I came across Sapolsky who is viewing this behavior through a genetic and biological lens. I don’t have a full enough grasp yet to do a proper summary but basically: Our brains are hard-wired to deal with the world in us vs. them terms, and much of that is occurring in our brains pre-consciously. (I say pre-consciously because it often is happening before the signals even get processed by your cortex.) The current situation is that many U.S. citizens have been trained (and have trained themselves) to see the opposite side as completely other. A mortal threat in the way a tiger stalking you is a mortal threat.

I believe that because all of this very strong impulse is coming from a subconscious place, efforts to counteract it with reasoning lead to the person becoming very frustrated and quickly angry. You’re saying “there is no tiger” and their lizard brain is saying “bad tricksy is trying to get the tiger to eat us.”

But consciousness and ego are where most people spend their time and where their (hopefully) stabilizing self is moored. So their conscious mind is working constantly to create “reasonings” that appear superficially to justify the signals coming up from the lizard brain but aren’t based on reason at all. If people didn’t do that I imagine they’d feel crazy. (This last part is just my own theory based on observations and my limited understanding of current cognitive science etc.)

 There's a sub dedicated to helping people whose family and friends are diehard Trump/Fox News supporters.

Check it out: r/FoxBrain***My mum is in the same boat as your dad. I'm so impressed with your commitment to debating and trying to get through to him, really incredible. Well done! I've never gotten that far with my mum because she won't open up to me to begin with, she knows we'll disagree so she refuses to even talk about it.

The fact that your dad is willing to put in this effort, all be it - frustrating and not quite as well researched as you would like - he's still doing WAY more than people like my mum who won't even allow herself to be challenged. Please keep this in mind, he could have just refused, he could have been too scared to have his bubble burst. I think he sounds reachable. BUT - if reaching him is at the expense of your mental health, then you need to give it a break. 

I hope one day I can get half as far with my mum as you have with your dad, i really respect how you've approached it and I wish you all the best, whether you throw in the towel or not, your dad knows you have made the effort and tried to come to an understanding, and i'd imagine this means a lot to him, and probably you also.***My advice is preferably you shouldn’t talk about politics at all, but if you do, frame it in a way that is positive and forces your dad to step away from repeating propaganda and instead forces him to think for himself and give genuine answers. Figure out which things you can agree on. NEVER CALL IT A DEBATE. If you’re trying to do a debate, you will not have a productive interaction. Your dad will come armed with rhetoric and be a good footsoldier for his side, just repeating garbage back to you, and forcing you into a situation where you are forced into using rhetoric back at him to counter his claims. It should always be a DISCUSSION. Cater the discussion so that he can’t just spew rhetoric that he read online that morning at you. Better yet, if he claims to be a conservative, use a conservative standpoint for your discussion and explain how nothing trump is doing is conservative***I respect what you're doing here.

I think choosing to focus on ad hominem attacks is a mistake though. It's a fallacy for a reason. No amount of showing someone how biased OAN or Prager is really proves anything because being biased doesn't mean someone is wrong, and that's what your dad is going to be thinking. You came away thinking you had made progress by excluded Prager, but your dad doesn't think you made any point at all you just limited his ability to communicate to you by invalidating one source. Does that prove anything at all about the points you're arguing? Not a thing.

Instead allow his poor sources, but attack their arguments directly, and your dad will slowly learn who is credible just based on how well they stand up to close scrutiny.

You should only resort to attacking the source if you have no other arguments to attack, otherwise you're just playing for a draw.***This is how trump fans wear you down and claim victory-same as trump. The barrage of falsehoods  makes most quit. Then they claim victory. The only way I can tackle it now is this: why and what do you hate about liberals? Cuz that’s the REAL crux of it all. They don’t believe trump...they just hate his “enemies”. Focus on the emotional issues underlying his hate.***Others have said this: but you have shown a great deal of patience and forebearance with your father. You obviously care deeply about this relationship. You've shown more patience than almost anyone I can think of in this matter.

There's a few things you might want to consider though: is conservatism about rationality?

This is not a tongue and cheek question. It's serious. When someone in my facebook feed or in my friends circles cites Breitbart or similar sources unironically, I've learned that they're not operating based on reason, evidence, or logic. I can remember one instance in which a friend cited the Daily Wire. I engaged him in a good faith, patient conversation, about some of the things it said. Mainly, it alleged something about a proposed law, when the actual text of the law said that it designed to do the exact opposite. I presented my friend with this, and he wanted to continue the conversation as if we needed to ""hear both sides"" of the issue, despite the fact that his source had misrepresented things.

I literally do not know how to explain to something that primary source (the text of the proposed Law) corrects the reporting secondary source (The daily wire article), about what \*itself\*. I literally do not know how to explain to a conservative how fact checking works.

If you've felt this similiar frustration with your father, than I would not encourage you to continue with this organized debates. The disagreement has gone well beyond investigation, and into epistemology.

I once listened to a podcast that described ""conservative brain"" versus ""liberal brain."" Conservatives have a measurable fear/negativity bias. This doesn't mean everything they say is wrong, but it does mean that they'll find certain appeals much more persuasive than liberals would. I've also heard it argued that conservativism means ""a strong need for a rigid order"" and preference for the tried and comfortable rather than the novel. I've heard it described that conservativism is fundamentally about maintaining social hierarchies.

I've also read about ""motivated reasoning.""

If you start looking at conservativism as \*disposition\*, a list of personality traits, and prefered types of moral/rhetorical appeals, than conservativism makes more sense.***It's tougher with family members; might be better to treat them with unconditional love, and talk about other things at family gatherings 😎 we all can and should push back against the disinformation in the public sphere, but with family this is generally a losing proposition.....

It might be better to start by debating other topics which would require logical thinking but isn’t as polarizing. Maybe start by debating ethics or epistemology. Maybe discuss articles from the Wall Street journal. It leans right but isn’t complete garbage. The economist is more left leaning but still pretty objective and not too radical. Why not gift him a subscription? You should listen to their intelligence podcasts together and discuss them. Maybe discuss some books on the economy.

This is a conversation that should be happening on the national scale. The reversion is a massive problem too, The media seems to have done an excellent job of turning people into confirmation bias zombies. 

Another topic I'd try to slip in somewhere is the veracity of DT himself. There is even a whole Wikipedia page of citations you can use. To double down I'd add in the veracity of the right wing media sources. 

Anyway good luck! I guess we've got to un-brainwash all these people one at a time.***Just wanted to say I’m super impressed with your efforts. The closest trump supporting family I have our cousins who I just snooze on Facebook and try to chuckle instead of crying. 
I think I’ve recently realized my true privilege in life is having an open minded, critical thinking family.***👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼for the effort. 

I’m in the same boat except my father really doesn’t read anything other than memes and the stock tickers scrolling the screen of Fox. This is much farther than I’d ever be able to get. 

The root problem is the same: brainwashed by Fox and cannot see it. Your strategy to agree upon facts is correct, though, and could eventually pay off. As the dust settles from the Trump loss, narratives will begin to shift (as will his mindset).

What we have to correct for after January will be different, more subtle. Trump’s base will get trickle-truthed by the media until they subconsciously realize they were lied to. 

I’ve been trying for four years. My dad had the audacity to tell me I need to do my research. He doesn’t even read, and I’m working on my Masters in Sociology, researching misinformation. The bubble is incredibly difficult to pierce. That’s what it’s like when people are in a cult. 

One thing to point out is it works both ways. I like to say you don’t blame the sheep for the shepherd. People are susceptible to manipulation just as they are marketing. It doesn’t *necessarily* make them idiots or racists, but they do have biases/beliefs that are being exploited. This is part of what my research is looking into. 

Keep fighting the good fight. If we don’t attempt dialogue with the people who are lost, society is lost. Communication is the key to the kingdom.

Edit: please let us know how it goes as this an inspirational to me! And you can DM if you want to vent more. I truly understand and empathize.***  Your father wants something, something he finds in conservative media, even if its only an illusion of what he really wants. Frankly, being you fathers age, I want it too. We want the America of our youth, a big, strong, rich and generous country, where people were polite, friendly, and unafraid of poverty. where high school, or trade school or even hard work, was enough to ensure your family security and a nice life. Union jobs were plentiful, and deals were made with handshakes. 
  That America, sadly, is gone. 
The differentiation between you two is the REASON WHY it is gone. Conservative media pushes a narrative that is easy to follow, points fault away from its viewers, and offers a simple path to that America... even as simple as MAGA. 
  Liberal Media has its own narrative too, a mixture of ""Its actually better now then then because we are more ""woke"", Business and technology is ushering in the future, and some  ""its all the stupid, ignorant conservative hicks who have been duped to act and vote against their own interests fault"". 
  Sadly however, neither of these narratives will ever bring your fathers America back. 
  Try asking him, in a constructive way, what has changed for him, and why he thinks it has changed. Research his thinking, see what historians, economists, and the data say. 
 That's the best discussion to have, instead trying to ""convince"" him he is wrong. He may have more ideas apart from his media bubble than you give him credit for, and you may end up enjoying your conversations.
  I hope so.***Have you heard of the book How to Have Impossible Conversations? I think it could help you tremendously in your efforts.

There is a sub reddit based around this book and other's like it: r/StreetEpistemology

Thank-you for what you are doing. I hope you continue and get us updated.***I admire your tenacity.  I tried at first to convince my Sister and Brother in Law (both staunch Trump supporters who believe the 8 years of Obama were the worst years in the history of the USA, and both of whom served as Officers in the USAF, very educated and competent people) of who Trump is, narcissist, xenophobe, racist, homophobe, most destructive chief executive since George W Bush, but eventually I gave up and now I just avoid any discussion of politics at all with them.  This has unfortunately had the effect of a marked decrease in interaction with either of them.  

I wish I had been able to bridge the gap but just as the poverty gap grows, so does the political chasm.  It's nearly impossible to find a middle ground.  If makes me feel hopeless.***You might want to read ""Don't think of an elephant"" which argues that you need to approach it from a values perspective not a fact perspective. That's how I have tried to argue with my conservative father. I get him to try to own the awful values that Trump is exposing. But my father is very determined on maintaining a relationship with my brother and I so he'll cut off the arguments before they get to visceral or deep. 

I generally find that it's almost pointless arguing with him because he sleeps with Fox news on he listens to Fox News 24/7 and I just can't outdo it, the only saving grace I have with my father is he doesn't seem to go further right than Fox News.

The other book that comes to mind is ""They thought they were free"", which is about a Jewish professor who goes into post world war II Nazi Germany and interviews Nazis. He has a particularly good discussion over what it would take to change people's minds. Essentially he came to the conclusion that these people were so grounded in propaganda that even after they lost the war they didn't see what they did as wrong, and was convinced that if they had won the war they would certainly have seen it as right. 

I truly believe that fighting propaganda has to be one of our biggest civil challenges.***You need to live your life and he needs to live his. You've already invested way more than you need to. There are consequences to being brainwashed and insane. Lots of people are cutting friendships and ties with family. A lot of times this is the healthiest thing to do. Your dad has been radicalized. You're never going to get through to him.***You know, I can relate you you here. Both of my parents are intelligent, caring people. My mom is involved with helping the homeless in our community. She's seen firsthand the difficulties I've had with health insurance because of my pre-existing condition. My dad went to a good school and is a smart guy with plenty of empathy. Yet in spite of all of that, they both still support Trump. They have accepted that he lost the election so it's not too bad, but it's hard to accept that they still voted for the man.

 It comes down to where they're getting their information (just like your dad) and their personal wealth. They don't want to pay higher taxes, even if it's a net benefit to society and even themselves in the long run. They voted purely for economic reasons. It's very frustrating. However neither of them would take the time that your dad has. I'm extremely impressed by you.

Keep doing what you're doing. Keep pointing out how unreliable his sources are. It might take time, but you might be able to get through to him at least about reliability of sources. My dad listens to Rush Limbaugh every day and I really wish he wouldn't.***Honestly unless this is fun for you, I would give it a break. Write him a heartfelt letter, and urge him to think back to when you were growing up. How did he teach you to find sources? How did he teach you to avoid peer pressure and think for yourself? Tell him you love him and you’re here to help him if he wishes, but then let him go. You can only hope that five years down the line, many people will have the spell of Trump broken and come back to reality. Then you can have your relationship back.

Ps if you do like debating, it might be fun to debate with your dad about something else besides the current political situation. Are there any “conspiracies” you believe in? Like JFKs assassination or alien life forms? This might help him find sources that are not related to Fox News and he might rethink what he finds credible. Especially if the shoe is on the other foot so to speak.***I'm not sure that these debates will work until he stops watching FOX propaganda entertainment. I wish you well on trying though. I managed to get my lightly Trump sympathizing father to see how shitty Donald is, but it required getting him to stop listing to the AM radio stations that were poisoning his mind every day first. He pretty much changed over night after that without me needing to much of anything further.***You should go to r/asktrumpsuppoters to get an idea for how to discuss these things. From my experience there, people have varying degrees of refusing open mindedness for their own biases. It sounds like your dad is actually pretty open minded which sounds hopeful. A couple recommendations: ask him to elaborate his thoughts on a topic and whenever you hear something that sounds off, dive into that. I’d start with the big picture issues like environment and inequality first. Those are probably easiest since there exists less rationale for opposing income equality and action on climate change.***Thank you so much for putting so much effort into this. I am working on family members too***I think the big thing to prevent him from going back is to target his sources with sources that are recognized as non partisan. Like it fox is his source then use trusted non partisan sources like NPR and PBS. Once fox is no longer a source then it will no longer be an uphill battle. I've talked to a friend that lives in Oklahoma. After years of taking to him, he changed him mind and didn't vote for trump this time around. The big thing is not about proving them wrong but finding a mutual ground that both can agree on. If he can agree to take fox off the table then agree to a concession that CNN is liberal and off the table. And so on...***Someone posted a similar thing a few months ago. I can’t find it, but the essential point was that 1) you’re doing all the work 2) he doesn’t want to change his perspective- and that’s why you keep finding new and new facts and inFormation. This isn’t a true debate where he is open to changing his mind. 



He’s Jewish, supports immigrants and abortion. Can he explain why he now supports an anti-semantic pro-life anti-immigrant President?***Amazing!***Damn. Way to go, man.

Your debate is admission of loss already. My dad is almost the same except uneducated and racist. (drops the n bomb)... You can't fix stupid.***I think a problem with the most recent topic is that it's clearly biased.  Maybe a better topic might have been science in general.  Or the science of Corona. Or Republican science in general. But the way u worded it, even though I agree with the point, it's confrontational against the Republican party. But I mean... I guess that's fair.  If u have a problem with the Republican party, and you have a good reason, than that shouldn't be a problem.  But I think if you're trying to find equal ground, you should have made your topic less of an accusation.***To put things bluntly, your dad does not know how to fact check. Good for you on doing it for him, but until he learns this very simple skill, he will never get anywhere and all it will do is drain you of all your energy. It's easier for someone to put out 10 lies than it is to debunk one of those lies, and that's the problem you're running into - you're never going to get through all the lies as they'll just put out more.***This is what I have to say, ignore the politics and debates and just focus on the fact that he's your dad and that he loves you, at some point politics will tear both of you apart from each other, quit discussing politics and spend some goddamn quality time with the man. going fishing or helping him fix his power tools or other normal father son stuff, if you are wondering what party I support I'll have you know I supported Kanye 2020***Don't forget Brandolini's Law: the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it. Trump supporters can find an inexhaustible supply of Breitbart, Newsmax, Prager, etc. The bullshit will never end.

It should be *obvious* to anyone reading those sources that they are hyper-partisan and short on facts. The right-wing has mastered ""alternative facts"", they have weaponized and monetized lies.

In short: you are probably wasting your time. Facts won't change your dad's mind because facts aren't why he is an extreme Trump supporter.

jvax1l,"If you have trouble with the paywall, here is the text of the op-ed:

---

This was probably the way we should have expected President Trump to finish his time in the White House: whining, lying, ignoring the duties of his office, desperate to keep his scam going and focused only on himself. But that Trump is being Trump should not for one second blind us to what is happening right now and how damaging it is. The destruction of the past four years was apparently not enough for him. So on his way out the door, Trump is salting the earth behind him.

It has been nearly two weeks since the election. President-elect Joe Biden won the electoral college by 306-to-232. His lead in the popular vote is 5.6 million and growing. Republican efforts to get courts to shut down counting and invalidate huge numbers of votes are being laughed out of court. This is over.

And what is the president doing? Complaining on Twitter.

He will not prevail, and everyone knows it. The White House staffers desperately spinning on his behalf know it. The Fox News hosts propagating conspiracy theories about stolen votes know it. Every elected Republican knows it. The only ones who don’t know it are the millions of Trump voters who are the targets of this noxious propaganda campaign, the ones being told that American democracy is worthy of nothing but contempt.

Trump tells them that our system of elections is impossibly corrupt, that only the Republican Party can legitimately claim power no matter what the will of the public actually is, and even that street violence is not only justified but should be celebrated when committed by the far right.

Meanwhile, his White House instructs civil servants across the federal government to refuse to cooperate or even communicate with representatives of the incoming Biden administration, making the already complex task of the transition vastly more difficult. And while the coronavirus pandemic is positively exploding across the country — we’re now averaging more than 150,000 new cases and a thousand deaths per day — his administration has stopped even pretending it cares.

At the current pace, by the time Trump leaves office, more than 300,000 Americans will have died of covid-19. And even after he departs, every day more will die because Trump politicized simple public health measures, convincing his supporters that refusing to wear a mask to protect yourself and those around you is a great way to own the libs.

No president in American history has ever before spent the end of his time in office trying to discredit our democracy, degrade the federal government and set Americans against each other. And what of the Republican Party? They, too, are finishing the Trump presidency the way they started it, with a show of complicity and cowardice.

There are some Republicans, the most repugnant, who are enthusiastically whipping up anger and spreading lies about voter fraud, trying to convince their base that Biden will be an illegitimate usurper. At the other end, there are a few who have grudgingly acknowledged reality, admitting that yes, Biden won the election and will become president in January. But there are so few of the latter group that when one says, “I expect Joe Biden to be the next president of the United States,” it makes the news.

The rest of them are hiding, too craven to even answer that simple question. “We invited every single Republican senator to appear on Meet the Press this morning,” said NBC’s Chuck Todd on Sunday. “They all declined.” The reason was clear: They can’t defend Trump and don’t have the guts to tell the truth about what he’s doing.

So please, let’s not hear anyone praise those few Republicans willing to say that Biden is going to be president and the transition should proceed with some measure of professionalism. That’s nothing to be proud of. What we deserve is to hear Republicans say to Trump, “Stop this right now. You are hurting the country.”

But there are none who will do so. So to them we should say: The leader of your party is pouring poison into our national bloodstream, and if you can’t find the courage to say it’s wrong, don’t ever try to tell us again how patriotic you are.

Over the past four years, I’ve thought often about how just a few days after the 2016 election, President Barack Obama welcomed Trump into the Oval Office. Trump had turned himself from a reality show buffoon into a political figure by becoming the country’s foremost advocate of the racist “birther” lie, accusing Obama of not being a real American, then ran a campaign of fear and hatred to win the presidency.

Yet Obama was polite and gracious. Like every American president who came before him, he knew that what mattered at that moment was not the disgust he surely felt for his successor nor his fear of what the future might bring. What mattered was showing Americans that democracy is about all of us, a shared enterprise we have to work to sustain.

Later, Obama would leave Trump a letter welcoming him to the Oval Office, just as George W. Bush did for him and other presidents had done in the past. Here’s part of what it said:

> We are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions — like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties — that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it’s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.

No president amasses a perfect record of protecting those democratic institutions and traditions. But at the moment their presidencies ended, every one — even those who left in disgrace — remembered that there are principles and commitments more important than their own petty grievances and wounded egos.

jx3clc,"It's a culture + education + diversity difference combined with a growing concern by rural communities about being ignored. 


People in cities interact with more cultures. The jobs in cities often require more education. Communities in cities are much more diverse. In a city elections, the question is which candidate address the concerns of all of these demographic cohorts. The culture is constantly evolving. The problems are constantly changing very quickly with evolving populations and logistical challenges. 


In rural communities almost none of this happens. The community problems don't evolve the same way. It's always *""how can we preserve our way of life""*. Rural communities are facing population decline, brain drain, and steady job loss. 


Republicans made a pivot toward shoring up voters who want to keep things as they are, and fight inevitable change. They cling to religion, despite a steady generational decline in religious affiliation. They fight minority communities, despite the coming demographic shift making America a majority non-white by 2040. They fight against green technology, despite it quite obviously being the future of energy and jobs globally. Even stupid things like diet. They fight vegetarianism, despite the growing trend for people to eat plant based diets. 


It's a Republican strategy and ideology that insists on fighting change and trying to preserve of things a moment in time where their voters are wealthy, influential, moral leaders who are respected nationally and globally. 


It's been a steady decline since Reagan.***Education!!! Exposure to different people!***Having lived in the rural Midwest, the suburban Midwest (just outside St. Louis), the rural Northeast, and the suburban Northeast (just outside Boston) over the past 60 years, I feel like maybe I understand a little of it?

I think it's a combination of economics and insularity.

Rural communities have suffered as the US' economy has shifted away from an industrial / agrarian base towards a service / information base.  This has been going on since the 1970s at least, and I lay a lot of the blame at the feet of Nixon's secretary of Agriculture, Earl Butz.  That's when the US began a shift away from encouraging small, family-scale farms and towards encouraging mega-scale “corporate” farming.  Consistent food surpluses drove prices down, which was great for consumers and US international aid programs, not so great for farmers and the communities that serviced them.  Policies like the ones he set in place have, as their logical end-game, cheap chicken and pork being produced in enormous  confinement sheds, typically to the detriment of the local ecology (too much manure to dispose effectively), the health of the animals (need to routinely feed them antibiotics to keep them alive, which results in a rise in antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens), and ""farmers"" being essentially serfs bound to raise animals as their corporate overlords dictate, sell animals only to those overlords, shoulder the bulk of the financial risks of building out the facilities to the overlords' specs, etc etc.  All of this has a knock-on effect on the economy of local communities -- there's just not as much money to be spent with local stores and businesses.

So, in the absence of all other factors, I don't blame rural folks for being desperate for better jobs.  Or any jobs.  Republicans promise them jobs.

On top of that, most rural folks really just aren't exposed to the same breadth of peoples, cultures, and ideas that urban people are.  If you're living in northern Iowa, you're less likely to encounter people of color, or Hindus, or Jews, or pick-your-favorite potential dividing line for xenophobes.  It's easier to believe that ""all urban blacks are lazy leeches"" if you've never met any, or that ""all Muslims are terrorists"", or that ""atheists are baby-killing Satan worshippers"", etc.

And boy, has rightwing media been happy to miseducate rural folks.  To tell them that they're the ""real Americans"", the heat & soul of the country.  ""Vote for Republicans, and we'll keep you safe from everything you fear.""  And they fear many things, just from sheer ignorance of what those things or people really are.

Obviously the things I've said don't apply to all rural people, or all urban people.***People in cities tend to be more cosmopolitan and multiethnic, exposed to more ideas, information and opinions, better educated, less traditional, and more free to be non-conformist.

People in rural areas tend to be more religious, more traditional, more mono-cultural and less educated.***Well....wow. Such a simple question with a plethora of different answers that can all be correct.

Firstly, no one has mentioned identity politics or party branding. Blue collar/white collar, book smart/common sense, working with your hands/working behind a desk, college degrees/great paying trade work.

Take Law Enforcement as one example. In rural areas people own firearms not only for hunting (another traditional identity politics issue) but also for self-defense of family and property. Now, in rural areas the Police response can be quite a while. To that end, rural people look at it as LE and the community working hand in hand to keep the community safe. Reporting crimes, stopping violent crime, etc. The Officers are people in your community that these people will see in church. As such, the dynamic is totally different (a theme across the entire issue you're asking about). When an Officer stops you in a rural area, it will 99% of the time be a traffic stop, so be kind and respectful to the Officer.

It is incomprehensible to rural people that someone would have a gun on them by Police, be given a direct order, and just ignore it and reach inside their vehicle.

Rural America is more traditional. It's slower. And they LIKE IT THAT WAY. People across the U.S. move out of the country to the city because they want to. And it works the other way around as well. People in the city don't mind taxes because look at all they're provided. People in rural areas see state taxes taken out or local taxes and they wonder what the hell they're getting for their money. The roads are ok, the schools are usually mediocre at best and 33% of Americans STILL don't have access to high speed internet and those are basically all rural Americans. It's a self reliant streak.

 Rural America feels they've been sold down the river for the new economic order, they've become a punchline, with seemingly little lasting help from Washington DC. So the mentality has become, ""Fuck you then. Leave me alone and I'll do it on my own."" The last time the government really gave broad, lasting help to rural America was probably the Rural Electrification Act. It put electricity in EVERY Americans home.


What you're inquiring about is a tale as old as Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. I know I was all over the place. I hardly new where to begin, and I wanted to touch on things not mentioned yet. I'd love to continue this conversation though. However, these are all simply my opinion. I'm pretty Liberal by American standards, but I'm a son of Virginia and grew up rural. And I understand a lot of these people's concerns. Still despise the Republican party though.***I haven't seen anyone give the most obvious answer. Densely populated areas have more shared services by necessity (hence stronger government). You are in the same boat as your neighbor. You both use the same subway and bike paths and visit the same park. Same goes for social problems: Homeless people are your problem when they pee on your doorstep. 

Rural areas simply require less governance. Burning a pile of leaves doesn't fill your neighborhood with smoke because the nearest neighbor is 2 miles away. There is no subway, very few shared services. Is it any wonder they want the government out of their lives?***So I was raised in a very conservative area and would’ve considered myself a Republican (mostly just political ignorance, in my case) before moving away to a bigger city and switching parties.

I think there are a lot of valid explanations in this thread, but also a bit of underselling to the rural case. Political and cultural ignorance is part of it, but there’s also a real feeling that rural communities have been abandoned by the rest of the country. And frankly, I don’t think that feeling’s entirely misplaced. 

Democrats prefer strengthening federal govt over state govts which rural communities don’t love as broad solutions for the whole country are often out of place in its smaller, more rural communities. One example would be the minimum wage, the Democratic push is for a national minimum wage at $15, but in what world does the same minimum wage for small town Kansas and NYC make sense? The living wage where I’m from is $11, so advocating for $15 really feels like someone who has forgotten that places with low cost of living exist. (Also, it should be higher than $15 in NYC, but that’s besides the point)

Also, speaking for the Midwest specifically, I think Midwesterners are more unnerved by high national debts than other Americans. Now, I know that the Republican Party is no better and probably worse than the Democratic Party on lowering that, but they pay lip service to minimizing it in a way that people from my hometown really really respected. Add Fox News propaganda about who’s actually enacting fiscal responsibility and the result is communities who treat Democrats as any idiot who doesn’t understand money. Now, a bit of history as to why this matters in the Midwest, specifically. The Midwest used to be a place of small family farms which has really dropped off in recent decades. Some of this loss is just selling out, but a lot of it was actually caused by farmers losing their homes and livelihoods in the 1980s Farm Crisis, a bit of history that few outside the Midwest even remember. Most rural, Midwestern adults can remember those debts exploding in the faces of their families and neighbors; my mom still tells stories about the rash of suicides in her town that decade. The cultural memory of those rural communities is that if you go into debt like that, you risk losing everything, and they apply that to the national debt, too. Republicans may not actually help it, but Democrats don’t even talk about it as a concern, which terrifies people who grew up with real reasons to be debt-averse.

So yeah, don’t get me wrong, rural loyalty to Republicans is misplaced, but Democrats don’t do a great job of listening to their concerns, either. It’s complicated and ultimately, nobody cares about rural communities. Republicans are too busy propping up big businesses and Democrats are too focused on big cities. They have some reason to feel forgotten.***There are already some well written responses here so I won’t rehash it all but for me it’s exposure to other cultures.

Conservatives like the status quo and fear people different from themselves. This is reinforced by their homogeneous surroundings.

Liberals embrace the differences between our neighbors and seek equality for those denied it. They likewise are brought face to face with the shortcomings of society and seek to improve it (rejecting the status quo).

Edit: In short, living in a city makes you see some shit that needs addressing and be more comfortable with people with different backgrounds from yourself. Since conservatism at its core is keeping things as they were at the founding of the country, all change is bad. So urban people tend to move in the opposite direction when they see the effects of the ongoing issues.***I live in a rural area.

It's definitely a combination of a few things, one of the biggest being education.

People around here are people of modest means. They have never been deeply encouraged to seek out college degrees or any furthering of education in general. They aren't even very honest about their opinions on things around people they might suspect are liberal, as was proven a few days ago when I overheard some people I didn't realize were Conservatives talking about the ""China Virus"" as they put it.

People in rural areas just... don't have anything. They know what they want, but it's basically sold to them in this ""you can trust only us"" package where Republicans are venerated as saviors even if it's not remotely true. These people have been told all their lives that things will get better if they just vote Republican. I know, because I've known some pretty hardcore Republicans around here.

Because there's no need for higher education in an area with mostly farmland, because corporations keep people in rural areas under their thumb, and because Democrats and Leftist thinking in general become suppressed, there's a really potent Republican and Conservative influence across rural counties. And the story is mostly the same all across America.***Also try r/AskAnAmerican !***Lack of education, political leaders taking advantage of cultural prejudices to scapegoat vulnerable groups, fear of change***More wealthy people don't necessarily live in cities. Cities are denser. Plenty of the richest people are in the suburbs and plenty of the poorer people are in the city because that's where the jobs are.***Sadly, many in ""rural America"" have retreated into the talk radio / foxnews / newsmax fantasy world that they have created .... While I hate to sound so negative, it seems that millions of Americans have rendered themselves impervious to fact based arguments.... and the social media companies (looking at you FaceBook) played a very big part .....***This is a bad place to ask such a question. 

You'll receive a lot of ""Well because cities have smarter, richer, more diverse, and more beautiful people. Rural communities bad, ugly, and stupid."" 

Reading through the comments, already 90% of the replies fall in this bucket.***Most of the downtrodden folk live in the cities. There are definitely rich people who live in cities, but there are far more poor people. Also, the rural people have this stereotype of being almost backwards, sticking to their traditional ways, which fits with republican ideals. The rich people don't have enough numbers to affect the cities votes when compared to the people who are under oppression.***My take:  

People in rural areas are not forced to interact with very many people and the people with which they do interact are exactly like them; white, agricultural-based, small-town mindset,  fearful of 'the other', with high ability to force conformity due the small town 'everyone knows what everyone is up to'.  This leads them to an authoritarian structure where no 'fresh blood' is ever allowed in to shake up the status quo. Thus, the very crux of 'conservative'.

People in urban areas have to deal with many, many other people not like them in many different ways.  They are exposed to different customs, foods, relationships, dress, accents, languages and many other things. These people learn to recognize that 'the others' are not that different from themselves.  They more likely recognize that almost everyone has values.  Thus, the very crux of 'liberal'.

In a word: ignorance.***As someone already pointed out, the tangible concerns of folk in rural areas are ignored by both parties and the Republicans play up the culture wars. 

I figure farming is expensive/not profitable considering how mega farming has become a thing. If would like to see a return of more family farms or at least more subsidies for these folk. 

In flyover country, cultural diversity is nonexistent outside of urban centers. Therefore if someone says ""[insert non-straight non-WASP group] is bad"", who is there to say otherwise? It's kind of sad that you can actually grow to hate or look down on people you've never met/unlikely to meet and will vote to make life difficult for them.***There are no leftists in politics in the USA. The democrats would be a center-right party anywhere else in the world.***People in cities are younger and more sophisticated. Only the old farmers are left out in the country***Moving around alot gives one perspective, especially having great role models.***It’s about exposure to others. Rural folks see them as a threat, urban voters know them as neighbors. And yes, urban folks tend to be more educated. That’s HUGE. Rural folks are ignorant of the world in many ways. And don’t come for me-I AM rural Iowan. I know my neighbors.***I might also add that, from my perspective as a native of the SF Bay Area, the suffocating atmosphere of conformity and heirarchal religious dominance there drives many people who are counterculture in some way out of the rural areas, and into the cities where they can simply be accepted for who they are instead of being derided and persecuted. LGBTQ, punks, hippies, wiccans, nerds, etc. All perfectly normal people who feel unwelcome, or at the very least lonely for likeminded folks, in their hometowns.***When you are an hour from the nearest police station or hospital, the people are more likely to be aversely affected by policies that may or may not work in a city or suburb setting. Gun control is stupid to people who see more dangerous animals than people on an average day, and you are more likely to hunt for food. You aren't going to the hospital unless it's very serious, so you probably know how to give yourself stitches and other basic medical procedures. There is less need for a government to dictate how someone lives their life if they aren't even using the services their taxes pay for. So you will be more likely to vote for policies that don't raise your taxes or tax/ban firearms necessary to your way of life.***In some ways your argument is on and in some ways spurious. The food argument: I am from a very small town in Idaho. I like trying new food. I like Japanese and Pho and look forward to going different places to try different foods. I haven't tried Indian, not because I don't want to but because I haven't discovered a place yet. Barring my bil the rest of us feel the same. Travel. Most everyone I know has traveled overseas. Multiple times. Education. Most of my family has degrees or some college. Working at Idahoan in any capacity in supervision requires a degree. Farming takes so much more education than just ""plow, plant, harvest."" Most of us eat meat because it is either locally sourced or home grown or harvested in a legal hunt. Many of us take pride in eating meals produced entirely by our own efforts. Diversity: so you are brown. So what? Same sex marriage? Who cares. Trans? Okay and I need to know, why? Change: If it is working why change, just for the sake of change? Going green: does hanging my clothes out to dry count? Yes I am rural. Yes I love being rural. Most of us like who we are and what we do. If you have the freedom to be who and what you choose to be, all I ask is the courtesy in return.***I come from a rural area, moved to suburbs and do business in cities; The divide is currently based on culture, civil rights(notably guns), and economics.

The poorer areas want more freer markets with minimal regulation, they see this as generally good for their class mobility. 

The appearance of the american left on the cultural matter... Even to people in the suburbs is appalling. A good anecdote for this is the shocking movement for deplatfirming and moving the overton window to the left by way of censoring.

People in the rural areas still see guns as important to defend themselves, not just from animals or thieves, *but from government tyranny.* The more that they feel censored and threatened, the more that this will be a dividing factor as well.***This divide could be fatal for the Democrats if it continues. We *need* to appeal to rural areas. It's an existential necessity.***Well it's really simple really. Rural people have to think for themselves and handle things themselves. With the introspection they realize the Republican party is better. Also, all that hard work means they believe you work hard for your keep. 

On the other end, city folk get together and spread nonsense which somehow becomes fact to them. They then relinquish any self-thought to the hive mind. Lastly, they are use to the government having to take care of them and believe everything they need should be ""free"" (others should have to work to give it to them) and they should not have to work for it.

Also, it's character. City folk are arrogant. Country folk are humble. Humility and the democratic party don't exactly go hand in hand.

As a person who's been both, city, rural, Democrat, Republican...I can say a lot is intolerance and economy. Democraps claim to be the party of tolerance but they are the first to attack and berate any conflicting opinions. That doesn't jive with free thinking hard workers.  And EVERYTHING is about race with them. Everyone has to be categorized as some group. Republican folk don't care. White black, purple, whatever.

But I know the real danger isn’t going to be from Democrats.***Not much of a thing with McConnell around***Hopefully close the gun show loophole, reinstate Obama era ban on people collecting ssdi benefits from buying guns, hopefully nothing else.

There hasn't been any *major* gun control legislation on a federal level since the Brady act in '92 - '93.

Same as happened during the Obama Presidency. The only real change of note was that guns became more available and could be carried more places.

Oh, and of course, the gun industry made megabux by promoting the lie that Obama was some gun grabbing fanatic who would take away everyone's guns.***""Voluntary"" buybacks, or NFA registration, or become a felon. 

The issue I have with it is option A you won't be paid nearly the proper value for your gun. That amounts to the government stealing from you if it's not voluntary and I think voluntary is a misnomer here.


The issue I have with option B is it applies a potentially huge tax on things, that in my case, I've owned 10 years. AR15s and 30 rd magazines will be defined as NFA items requiring registration at $200 a pop. For 2 ARs and 10 mags that's $2400. 


Option C is you are now a criminal guilty of a very serious crime. 


To me option B makes option A not look so voluntary. To me it is at best a tax grab and at worst a clear statememt that ""we don't trust the poor with guns."" This is the antithesis of the values of the democratic party, and won't be effective.


I want singlepayer healthcare (m4a is too weak imo), I want equal opportunity for all people, I want women to be able to choose, and I want this country to stop the systemic discrimination against the poor and widening of inequality. 


As I see it those are supposed to be the values of the democratic party. That last value seems contrary to Bidens platform. The dems really need to fix their gun control platform...they'd win every damn time. 


All of what I've said is directly from the official Biden platform not fear mongering rightwing sites. Feel free to correct any of it. I don't think it has a snowballs chance in hell so I'll sleep sound enough with Biden in charge.***Hopefully he keeps his hands off our guns.

Would make America a much safer place as gun fanatics can’t really be trusted and guns are out of control. 2a gun crazies have proven during the reign of trump that their only reason for owning guns is to flex power, intimidate their community, attack governors they don’t like and flirt work becoming domestic terrorists. 

Any talk about “defending our freedoms from a Tyrannical government” went out the window as pure BS when they were the first in line behind Donald wearing brown shirts and trying to terrorize America and flat out attack peaceful civil rights activists.***I doubt anything of significance will get done so anything that happens will be broad bipartisan support and not controversial.

I'm from Minnesota myself and right after George Floyd I saw something I've never seen before. Right wingers sympathizing with the BLM movement which lasted right until Defund the Police showed up. 

We need to remember that we live in a democracy, meaning that we have to compromise on somethings somewhere. All of y'all running around saying that it's either your way or the highway are behaving in an authoritarian manner.  

I'd gladly compromise on the superficial in the slogan than to go nowhere sticking to the exact aesthetic of my beliefs.***If there is one thing you count on, its for Obama to always negotiate against himself. Just glad to be on the other side for once.***Its all about sending a certain message that will appeal to a lot of different people.  Its called marketing 101.

I'm a Brit and pretty liberal, by US standards I'm a screaming lefty snowflake (by UK standards that's slightly left of centre) and I have had to explain this concept more times than I care to recall.

90% of my friends many (like me) former military hear 'defund the police' and make the fairly logical assumption, especially when that slogan is used during a protest against police brutality, that we want to cut spending  on the police as a punishment for them doing a lousy job.

If you just read the slogan, often painted on placards at these protest marches, it's not a stupid assumption.

Then to make matters even worse the explanation of what we really want takes about 15 minutes and the attention span of some of these people is measured in seconds, even when they want to listen, you've already lost the audience who have only listened to your first line!***Ask for defunding- accept the offers to reform. Smart strategy.***This is a respectable point***Por que no los dos?***The whole system would have to be reformed for this to be effective.

Police across America are in open revolt against the mere concept of accountability. Why do you think they're being so rough with people demanding police accountability when they're pretty chill with every other protest, even the ones where people are openly advocating killing government officials?
Cops are throwing tantrums when civilian leaders try to institute accountability measures or ban dangerous tactics like no-knock raids. They have rejected civilian rule. Case in point: Police in Louisville staged a walkout after the mayor said he wanted more accountability like the voters do.***He's right. Politics is the science of the possible, and the first thing you need in politics is power.  You don't get power by alienateing the 90% middle class.  Democracy is about the center.

And what was the response from that faux-outraged, ""look at me"" Ilhan Omar?  ""It’s not a slogan but a policy demand.""

No. It really IS a slogan and, just like BLM, a really dumb one that is entirely counter-productive.

It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.""

kb9f33,"If you have trouble with the paywall, here's the text of the op-ed:

---

The next few months will be terrible. Several thousand Americans are now dying from Covid-19 every day; given the lag between cases and deaths, the daily toll will almost certainly rise through the end of this year, and if people are careless over Christmas it could surge even higher in the new year. Economic recovery has stalled, with employment still down almost 10 million from pre-pandemic levels.

The most we can hope for at this point are policies that mitigate the suffering, getting us through the horror while we wait for widespread vaccination. And a few days ago it seemed possible that we would in fact get some good news on the economic front. A bipartisan group of senators seemed close to agreement on a Covid relief bill that would fall far short of what we should be doing, but would be much better than nothing.

Then the lame-duck Trump administration intervened — destructively.

Before I get to what’s wrong with the administration’s proposal and why it may do a great deal of harm, let’s talk about what the goal of economic policy ought to be right now.

I still keep seeing news reports that frame congressional arguments about relief bills as a debate about “stimulus.” But stimulus is what you do when unemployment is high because people aren’t spending enough. And that’s not the problem we face.

Think about it. Why are there still two million fewer workers in “food services and drinking places” than there were before the coronavirus struck? It’s not because people can’t afford to eat out or go to bars. It’s because eating out and gathering in bars are dangerous activities. In many parts of the country these activities are, rightly, either banned or sharply restricted; even where they’re allowed, many people, understanding the risks, choose to stay home.

The role of economic policy in this situation isn’t to bring those jobs back while the pandemic is still raging — we actually don’t want a resurgence of employment in high-risk sectors until vaccines are widely available. What we should be doing, instead, is minimizing the suffering while we wait. That is, the issue isn’t stimulus, it’s disaster relief.

What should this relief involve? It should provide support for the unavoidably unemployed, sustain businesses through the dark months ahead and aid state and local governments that are suffering severe declines in revenues and that will otherwise be forced to make drastic cuts in essential services.

And no, this last problem isn’t restricted to blue states. In fact, six of the seven states expected to face the biggest revenue declines have Republican governors.

House Democrats have always been willing to pass a relief bill along the lines I’ve described. And as I said, until a few days ago the Senate appeared to be moving toward a bill that, while much smaller than Democrats wanted, would be better than nothing. The main obstacle seemed to be the determination of Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, to include a poison pill — a blanket exemption of businesses from any liabilities related to exposing their workers to Covid-19 risks. But observers were hopeful that an agreement could still be reached.

Then came the Trump administration intervention — a proposal from Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, that McConnell quickly endorsed even though it was disastrously wrongheaded.

I’m not sure whether the coverage of this discussion has fully explained just how bad Mnuchin’s proposal is. Many headlines emphasized the cost, a bit over $900 billion, which was similar to that of the emerging bipartisan bill, suggesting that the administration was weighing in with something positive.

In fact, however, the administration proposal completely eliminated the most important piece of any relief deal — expanded benefits for the unemployed — replacing it with one-time $600 checks that would be sent to everyone.

Again, think about it. For Americans who won’t be able to return to work while the pandemic is still raging, a one-time payment of $600 is grossly inadequate, while for those who haven’t lost their jobs it’s unnecessary. It’s true that people might spend some of the grant, boosting overall demand — but overall lack of demand isn’t the main problem right now.

So what is Mnuchin thinking? We can’t rule out sheer ignorance. It is, sad to say, entirely possible that, nine months into the pandemic slump, administration officials still don’t understand the basic logic of relief. Or they may be in thrall to the thoroughly debunked myth that unemployment benefits actually cause high unemployment.

Or maybe this proposal reflects the expiring administration’s special combination of delusion and cynicism. President Trump is still trying, in ever more desperate and destructive ways, to overturn the results of the election. And in his madness he may imagine that he will gain more politically from sending everyone another check with his name on it than from helping those truly in need.

Whatever the motivation, Mnuchin’s proposal couldn’t have come at a worse time. It may well undermine the economic relief millions of Americans need.***Neither.

Though it may be hard to imagine now, sometime in the not distant future, the emergency measures adopted this year to control the spread of COVID-19 will no longer be necessary. But California would benefit by keeping at least one of them in place for good: mailing a ballot to every active registered voter in the state.

When it became clear this spring that the pandemic was not likely to end before the Nov. 3 election, lawmakers acted to ensure that all active registered voters in California could participate without risking infection. Counties were directed to mail ballots to all voters, whether they requested one or not, and, with an onslaught of mail ballots expected, were allowed to start processing ballots extra early. The state also extended the grace period for mailed-in ballots to 17 days.

It was a wise move that paid off. By all measures, the Nov. 3 election in California was held successfully, despite all the wild-eyed stories and false tales of mail ballot fraud spread by the president and his loyalists. (In the end, the only potential large-scale voting fraud in California was perpetrated by the California Republican Party, which set up dozens of phony ballot drop boxes in violation of state law. )

Nearly 18 million Californians voted in this election, more than ever before. So many Californians voted early — motivated, perhaps, by the stories about possible mail delivery delays — that election day was relatively calm, with only a few long lines reported around the state. This is exactly how every election should go, pandemic or not. Why backtrack now?

That’s what Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), chairman of the Assembly Elections Committee, thinks too. He has proposed legislation to require counties to automatically send mail ballots to all active registered voters (some already do) and to offer tracking services so voters can make sure their ballots are received. This wouldn’t end in-person voting for those who need assistance or enjoy casting their ballot in the company of others, but it would let voters easily choose how and where they vote.

This change would only hasten a trend well underway in California. In the last four statewide general elections, most voters used mail ballots. Even without the emergency legislation this year, about 75% of the state’s voters would have been mailed a ballot, and about 90% of registered voters would be receiving a mail ballot in future elections, according to the Secretary of State’s office.

It just makes sense to standardize this clearly popular voting choice. It’s where California has been headed since the Legislature passed the Voter’s Choice Act in 2016 and allowed counties to ditch the traditional model of in-person voting on election day at many small precincts in favor of centralized vote centers where ballots could be dropped off or cast in person well in advance. Fifteen counties, Los Angeles County among them, have adopted those provisions.

But we need ballot drop boxes too. The Voter’s Choice Act doesn’t require counties to deploy them, but drop boxes should be mandatory if we move to universal mail ballots. In Los Angeles County, drop boxes were wildly popular — more than half of the 3.4 million mail ballots cast in the Nov. 3 election were collected that way.

Another election problem that lawmakers should fix: This year’s emergency arrangement notwithstanding, California law provides a grace period of only three days for ballots to arrive after the election (they must be postmarked by election day to be counted). That seems too short, given that it takes the Postal Service up to a week to deliver first-class mail.

And for heaven’s sake, lawmakers really ought to revise the 2016 law that allows unlimited third-party collection of ballots, or “ballot harvesting.” Previously, only a member of the family or household could deliver a ballot on behalf of a registered voter. We were worried about the potential for misuse even before it was used to justify the GOP’s fake drop boxes. We have no doubt that in future elections, there will be other creative uses of this law that undermine trust in democracy.

While we’re making an election reform wish list, Congress should use its authority over the “times, places and manner” of federal elections to standardize procedures for collecting and processing mail ballots. Ideally, those standards would look like those in California, where officials have gone out of their way to make voting easier and smoother — and are still looking for ways to do it better.***I don’t know. If they are counted prior to election day then ok. But waiting for 2 weeks sucked so bad.***I've lived in two states that have permanent vote-by mail, and I love it. Oregon conducted their elections in 2001-04 entirely by mail, and Colorado has an in-person option that only about 2% of voters take. One has to pay postage in Colorado to return one's ballot, or they can take the ballot to one of several drop-off points in your city or county.

Colorado validates the ballots prior to and on Election Day, entering the ballots but not pressing the ""total"" button until after the polls close. California could and should adopt a similar system. I would go further, were I Secretary of State, by posting election results as ballots are validated and entered on a daily basis, to include the number of ballots that need to be ""cured"" due to a failure in signature match or some other cause. Colorado already posts the number of ballots returned by Unaffiliated, Democratic, Republican and Minor Party members daily during the early voting period. Were Unaffiliated voters not two-thirds the size of the total of all other parties, that would give decent insight into how the election is proceeding, at least statewide.***But Republicans will never go for that.

The Electoral College’s certification on Monday of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory will leave just one final venue for President Trump and his supporters to challenge the results of the 2020 election: a joint session of Congress in January.

Every four years, the House and Senate come together to formally tabulate the electoral votes and raise any final concerns about the results. Normally, it is a perfunctory confirmation of the Electoral College vote. But this year, some of the president’s most strident supporters are threatening to transform it into a messy last stand by objecting to the results.

They are all but certain to fail, but not before a potentially divisive spectacle on the floor of the House that could thrust Vice President Mike Pence into the politically perilous position of confirming that Mr. Trump lost. Here’s how the process works.

### The Constitution gives Congress the final say in the election.

When the Electoral College meets on Monday, each state will formally cast its electoral votes for president. Mr. Biden is expected to receive 306 to Mr. Trump’s 232, making him the winner.

But the Constitution leaves it up to Congress to make the results final shortly before Inauguration Day. Article II, Section 1 says, “The president of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted.”

To that end, on Jan. 6, envelopes containing certificates showing the electoral results from all 50 states will be carried into the House chamber inside two bound mahogany boxes that date from the 19th century. Representatives of the newly sworn-in House and Senate, called “tellers” for the occasion, will pull them out one by one to determine whether each “seems to be regular in form and authentic” and present them to the president of the Senate — in this case, Mr. Pence — for inspection and approval.

### Lawmakers can object to any state’s results, but there is a high bar for rejection.

Congress has long interpreted the constitutional language to mean that lawmakers can lodge objections to the results as they are tallied. The current process was circumscribed in the Electoral Count Act of 1887.

It says that as the tellers read through the electoral results state by state, members of the House and Senate can submit objections in writing to a given state’s results. The objections only hold weight if they are co-signed by at least one member of each chamber; if not, they fail and the session quickly moves on.

It is not uncommon for a member of just one chamber to submit an objection as an act of protest. It happened most recently in 2017, when several Democrats objected to Mr. Trump’s win in key states, based on Russian election interference. But Mr. Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, had already conceded and no Democratic senator joined the effort, so the objections were quickly rejected.

Instances of a House member and a senator teaming up are more rare and last took place in 2005. If it occurred, the joint session would immediately pause so lawmakers could go back to their respective chambers to debate the objection for up to two hours. They would then vote on whether to toss out the electoral results of the state in question. Both chambers would have to agree to reject the votes, something that has not happened since the Reconstruction era.

“By ensuring that both chambers must reject a submission, you reduce the risk of Congress going rogue electorally and repudiating the results of a state,” said Edward B. Foley, a constitutional law professor at Ohio State University who studies the electoral process.

### Win or lose, Trump’s allies can succeed in casting a shadow on Biden’s victory.

Mr. Trump’s allies, led by Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, have their sights set on challenging five states — Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin — where they claim that widespread voting fraud occurred, despite the fact that all five states have certified that the results are valid and there is no evidence of any widespread impropriety.

The key will be recruiting a Republican senator to join them, and so far none has publicly committed to doing so. Without a senator, their efforts will quickly fail and Mr. Biden could be formally declared president-elect in under an hour.

If a senator did sign on to challenge the results, Republicans could force Congress into a final, messy debate over Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede defeat and his baseless claims of election fraud, which have been roundly rejected in court.

Given Democrats’ control of the House and Republicans’ narrow Senate majority, almost no one expects that they would have the votes to succeed in disqualifying a state — much less five. But the debate and vote alone would put Republicans in a difficult position, forcing them to choose between an uncompromising president and their belief in the electoral process. Their choices could likely go a long way in setting the future course of the party, faith in American elections and the perceived legitimacy of a Biden presidency by the Republican base.

### Pence may have the most uncomfortable task of all.

At the end of the process, it will be left to Mr. Pence to declare Mr. Biden the winner once and for all, albeit in tangled prose.

“This announcement of the state of the vote by the president of the Senate shall be deemed sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice president of the United States, each for a term beginning on the 20th day of January 2017,” Mr. Biden himself declared when he oversaw the tallying for Mr. Trump’s vote as vice president in 2017.

Mr. Pence is far from the first vice president to be put in the uncomfortable position of certifying his own ticket’s loss. Overseeing the session in 2001, Vice President Al Gore had to rule against objections that would have delivered the presidency to himself if they were sustained, eventually declaring George W. Bush the victor.

But Mr. Pence serves a uniquely mercurial president with a penchant for disregarding the democratic process. The joint session will be a final dilemma, forcing him to balance his loyalty to Mr. Trump and his own political interests against his constitutional and legal obligations.

### Precedent and statute give the vice president little wiggle room.

“There’s not much he can do,” Donald A. Ritchie, the Senate’s former in-house historian, said in an interview. “His job is really just to read them out aloud. It’s up to the members if they are going to do anything.”

His only other option may simply be not to show up, leaving the task of overseeing the session to Senator Charles E.

And even though Pelosi is saying she’ll put $2k checks up for a vote, she’s requesting unanimous consent, meaning all congresspeople must agree to it.

If you just want the moneyshot, here it is:

---

No, the reason McConnell opposes the $2,000 is that any further stimulus would accelerate the economic recovery. How much it would do so is hard to predict with precision, but it would certainly have some effect, and anything that helps the economy is bad for the Republican project of constraining, undermining and sabotaging Biden’s presidency.

So all McConnell needs is to drag this out for a few more days. If he can give Loeffler and Perdue the time to loudly proclaim their support for the $2,000 checks, it might not matter for their race whether the bill dies in the end. The best possible outcome is for them to win in part because they promised to bring more stimulus, but then for no more stimulus to arrive.

That’s because over the next two years, Republicans would very much like Americans to think that government has failed them. The more dissatisfaction and displeasure there is, the more likely it becomes that McConnell and his party can sweep the 2022 midterms, make Biden’s life hell and set the GOP up to retake total control of government in 2024 — even if it was largely their fault.

Back in 2010, McConnell famously said, “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.” He also desperately wanted Republicans to take control of Congress, which eventually they did.

Each candidate I’ve voted for had the potential to push the ball further down the field. 

If your goal is to minimize abortions, consider focusing your energy on proven methods to reduce unwanted pregnancies. Age appropriate, lifelong sexual education, condoms available in school, birth control covered as a basic medical expense, more food and shelter support for young families so they don’t have to make that hard choice, holding men responsible for their part in making unwanted pregnancies, etc. In places where policies like this are implemented, abortions drop precipitously. Focusing only on making abortion illegal won’t make them stop, it’ll just force those women who need them into situations that are significantly more dangerous for them (unless they are wealthy; wealthy women can always get safe abortions in other countries).***You have to remember that politics is a spectrum. Are there other issues that matter to you? Is religion your driving force? 

I too used to be Republican from a conservative family. My issue was fiscal responsibility. I started voting Democrat when I realized most Republicans were not actually fiscally conservative. They act like they are only when it suits them. Frequently the same can be said in regards to abortions. The vote to restrict abortions but if a mistress turns up pregnant they are first in line.***Is your vote determined by a single issue? How much damage are you willing to inflict on society because of all the other toxicity that has become attached to [that one, single issue?](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133)***This is the problem with being a single-issue voter.* The Democratic Party may be overwhelmingly pro-choice, but look at their entire platform and legislative record if you feel yourself leaning in that direction. You'll never agree with any one party on *all* of your convictions or views. You've got to decide for yourself if it's worth making the pro-choice concession in order to select someone from the party currently most interested in what's best for the country (I'm speaking of the current bi-partisan situation here; obviously there are more parties in the US, but realistically you have 2 choices). *Not* voting is always a choice, of course, but not very productive. There are other parties out there, but voting for them doesn't usually do much either, unfortunately.

It's good you're seeing the light, though. I voted Republican for my first few years as a voter because I grew up in a conservative household and that's what my family always was. Once I *really* started paying attention, I realized the GOP pretty much didn't stand for anything I believe in, and that's become increasingly true over the last 20+ years.

Gwen Stefani is an example of this attitude. She supports the right for other's to obtain safe abortions but would never choose to have one. That's what pro-choice means. It's a personal decision to be made between the mother, her partner and her healthcare provider.

>A federal judge on Friday dismissed a GOP-led lawsuit aimed at empowering Vice President Mike Pence to unilaterally overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, contending that the plaintiffs — Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and 11 Arizona Republicans who would have been electors for Donald Trump — lacked standing to sue.


>U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Kernodle, a Trump appointee based in Tyler, Texas, said the suit, which was filed against Pence, couldn’t be brought by an individual member of Congress, since it alleged an injury that would apply to the entire House and Senate.


>Gohmert had asked the court to declare that Pence, who is constitutionally required to preside over the Jan. 6 session of Congress to certify the results of the 2020 election, had the sole authority to decide whether some of Biden’s electoral votes should be rejected — and whether alternative slates of Trump votes could be introduced instead. But Kernodle said Gohmert’s argument relied on entirely speculative circumstances.***So much losing.",0.403809091,0.216739639,0.465553046,Positive,Judge throws out Gohmert suit aimed at empowering Pence to overturn 2020 election results,reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/kp17th/judge_throws_out_gohmert_suit_aimed_at_empowering/,1/2/2021,judge throws gohmert suit aimed empowering pence overturn 2020 election results

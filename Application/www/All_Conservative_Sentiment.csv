This is a bullshit question and Wallace knew it. They all knew it. They're equating militia groups with white supremacists; they're not the same. 

Are some militia members, and militias, racist? Absolutely. But this question is formed to indicate all militias are racist. Simply untrue. They're forcing the president to denounce not white supremacists, but lawful gun owners exercising their 2nd amendment rights. Which Trump, being smart, would never do because that's a pretty big part of his base.***I will say, anyone notice that Chris has disappeared from any other Fox News programs? None of them have had him on, surely he would have appeared on even one besides his own on Sunday?***Antifa burns buildings and create violence and he asks Trump to denounce White Supremacists which he has done a few times already and have not been the creators or participants in the riots, but he does not ask Biden to condemn Antifa. Asked Trump about a NY article about his taxes but not Biden about his son receiving shady millions from Russia and China?***A note to all fair minded people:

It isn't right wing, alt right, or conservatives that are burning down your cities and destroying property.  It's the left, always is, and always has been.

Wallace knew this, but he's a little chicken shit bitch, who is a beltway Democrat before anything related to journalism.***They are willing to label anyone they disagree with regardless of proof as a white supremacist or nazi because they think it devalues their opinion.***Worst. Moderator. Ever.***The left has created this narrative that Trump is a racist.  This is really the only weapon they have.  If you tell people lies long enough, they will start to believe it.  It‚Äôs unbelievable how far the media has been able to take this.  It has lost all integrity.***As long as militias aren't killing innocent people and causing violence, why is being a militia all of a sudden a bad thing? It says that they are necessary in the Second Amendment.***How are they even allowed to suggest something like this with no repercussions?  And people are dumb enough to believe that this is actually what‚Äôs happening despite seeing antifa and BLM actually destroying shit.***They're trying so hard to put militia groups in the same category it's pathetic!  But the others are just fine cause they fit their cause, burn loot & murder but not protect.***I‚Äôd love to know what he was thinking and if it was more than ‚ÄúI hope all my Leftist friends are watching tonight‚Äù. What an embarrassment. I guess this is what we should expect now that e be n journalism schools are disavowing the need for objective journalism.***They‚Äôre chasing phantoms and they know it.  White supremacy is not a big problem in this country.  Just remember the media makes money by magnifying problems...***Trump should have been like, ‚ÄúI unequivocally denounce white supremacy, but do not condemn militias as that is a right of the free people‚Äù.***I'm as conservative as the next guy.

But guys let's be honest here. Regardless of the semantics, not answering this question was a disaster for the president. Sometimes you have to play politician even if you feel strongly about something.

I'm black and it made me very uncomfortable that he would not answer that question. And I agree that the question was loaded and unfair. But still this looked bad....***Here's the thing, these cities were burning long before any right-wing militias showed up.***Chris Wallace was shamelessly in Biden‚Äôs corner all night.  We all saw who was burning down Kenosha and it wasn‚Äôt white nationalists.***It‚Äôs literal gaslighting.

Antifa is the one inciting violence, and yet they blame those imaginary right wingers.***They want trump to denounce the right wing militias that‚Äôs the main thing why so they dot. Show up to defend property or act as a counter to the left‚Äôs antifa soldiers who burn and beat at the pleasure of the Democratic party***Yes, white supremacists are bad.

But they are not the ones burning cities. And Kyle Ritterhouse is not one either, neither are the militias. Wallace was painting with a broad brush in that question.

Trump has constantly denounced white supremacy; the problem is he refuses to fall for the trap of answering a question that paints his base as racists when they lump them in on one of these loaded questions. That is what they are mad about, they want him to insult his base by getting him to imply they are racists just like they got McCain to do and it is driving them insane.***Chris Wallace is paid to be ignorant.***Fuck Chris Wallace. That guy is a fucking Weasel. Tries to be hard hitting but he's really a pussy.***White supremacists everywhere!!!!!!!

Lol***Can only speak on Kenosha but they're was 3 shootings and 2 deaths. All done by a right wing militia member. 0 Deaths caused by leftists or antifa members.***Regardless trump should of just said ‚Äúi condemn white supremacy‚Äù without hesitation. That would‚Äôve won him a lot of fence sitters, he likely lost them by making a big deal out of the question***Yeah, I totally agree with this and I *actually* do support Trump (unlike a lot of people who say they do but are actually just brigading from r-politics).

Unfortunately however, Trump did screw up really bad at the debate. To put it simply; he wasn‚Äôt presidential.  Now I know a lot of people like him because he *isnt* presidential but there are times where he has to uphold the dignity of the office he holds and this was one of those times. 

It was a gotcha question, but Wallace asked him this same question in 2016 and he *did* flat out condemn white supremacy on stage, I wish he just said ‚ÄúI condemn white supremacy‚Äù instead of pivoting to Biden and Antifa. 

For clarification I still plan on voting for him and Biden still fucking sucks but...I‚Äôm slightly less enthusiastic about the President than I was before the debate.***Chris Wallace works for the Murdochs 

People keep forgetting it

They all suck from the same teat - the globalist cash cow***U don‚Äôt have to vilify Chris the traitor far left radical Wallace‚Äôs claims. Most of us true Americans know the truth and know how to deflect propaganda. We all got the presidents back!***Please tell me he‚Äôs not moderating the next one, that was such a shit show***Stand by and stand down then.***So there you dumb ass.***Surely they can produce video evidence of their claims in this technologically advanced era...***Trump did though***Why does he have a job?  He is the most biased person I‚Äôve seen on tv. No, I take that back. Chris Cuomo takes the cake for that!  Either way, this guy‚Äôs a jerk.***confirmation bias media can type this shit all they want honestly, FBI has data on this, their findings say antifa isn't the threat with violence this year, they say the majority has been caused by alt-right white supremacist groups and that they're the #1 threat in the country. sorry but some people around here need to accept reality on this, the left needs to denounce their violent side, so does the right.

I can read this 2 ways, but took it only 1 way.

A. Read the statement again. Can it be inferred that he's talking about \*white supremacists\* starting the trouble in those Cities? Yes

B. Could it also be inferred that Wallace is talking about ""the violence in a number of those cities"" as a generality...and NOT that whait supremacists started that violence. Yes. And that's how I took it, honestly.

I like Wallace in general...think he's a straight shooter. I also think he was truly between a rock and a hard place trying to keep Trump in line with ""the rules.""

j3bkw4,"Somebody call Joe Rogan***Why not get actual debate moderators? There are debate clubs and people who must judge/moderate dozens of debates a year.***So Cruz's is proposal is that 1 left wing and 1 right wing commentator should be the moderators. An an example, he suggests Ben Shapiro, Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh on the right and Rachel Maddow, Chris Hayes and Chris Cuomo on the left. What do you guys think?

I think it would be a upgrade. I really don't see journalists as the smartest people when it comes to political analysis. I think investigating stories is a different skillset.***The questions should be submitted and voted on by the public.  Each question should be asked of both candidates.  While a candidate is answering the question, the other's microphone should be turned off.  When a candidate has exhausted the time for an answer, the microphone should be turned off.  The moderator's only task should be to direct a question to one candidate or the other.  In this case the moderator can be a high school student.***Issue imo is the candidates, not the moderators. If candidates are going to ignore their time limits and talk over each other than nothing the moderators can do without risking looking biased. 

I see a lot of people saying that Wallace was unduly biased against Trump, but remember that Trump was routinely ignoring or talking over him. Try doing that to your supervisor at work and see how biased they'll get against you. The double downside for Trump is that the more Wallace feels antagonized or ignored by the president, the less inclined he felt to be hard on Biden. Was it unbiased? No. Is it human nature? You betcha!***LOL, 'journalists'.***""Wallace acknowledged in an interview a day after the debate that he was disappointed in the outcome."" lol***Chris Wallace did a horrible job at keeping control and then being impropotionately hard on Trump and soft on Biden. 

Personally I think Dennis Prager would make a great moderator.***Rogan or bust***RO-GAN RO-GAN RO-GAN***I just want a debate moderated by Eric Andre. Is that too much to ask?***I honestly don't know what you want Wallace to do? You can't allow one person in the debate to constantly interrupt the other and harass. Trump was overwhelmingly hostile the entire time. It could have worked for him as a strategy to show his dominance but he doesn't know how to control it. When Biden was asked about filibusters and stacking the court, Trump should have kept his mouth shut and let Biden hang himself. Instead he interrupted and caused an out of control argument that forced Wallace to drop the question.***Joe Rogan for moderator***Future debates should be structured like this:

Each participating campaign may choose one moderator for the debate. Each moderator will be given the opportunity to ask an equal number of questions. However, each question must be answered by all participating candidates.

I imagine this to function similarly to a court room. The moderators are the lawyers, the candidates are the witnesses (and ones standing trial), and we are the jury.

It's time to dispense with the idea of unbiased moderators. Humans will always have biases, so we might as well go all in.***And for news anchors from both the left and the right to stop moderating.***Um, not to put too fine a point on it, after that performance calling Mr. Wallace a journalist is a bit of a leap. A journalist would come with a command of the facts, would know the policy positions of the candidates and their parties if available (as he knows the questions he is asking it would be pretty easy to do some research before the big event), and would ask straightforward questions rather than give a sermon and then ask a question...and would follow up on those questions.***‚ÄúJournalists‚Äù.   That‚Äôs rich.***Cruz 2024!***Ya, get real moderators who ask actual intelligent questions for a change instead of ""gotcha"" moments for a soundbyte.***Everyone loves it when you complain about the refs.  Makes you look strong.***[just like this](https://youtu.be/XdnhudgCycI)***They 100% need Tim Pool to moderate***Think his wife has forgiven him?***Cruz should be worried about the obvious so liberal bias of whoever told him that beard looks good.***The way today‚Äôs journalists are, it makes sense to try and find more unbiased people not trying to get headlines***Put them each in a clear, soundproof booth. They can only hear the moderator, and their opponent. They can‚Äôt hear the audience, for example.

Rules are clear, with a visible clock. Each side get a total amount of time to ‚Äúspend,‚Äù but they can spend varying amounts based on the question. The mic is off if it‚Äôs not your turn.

You decide when you are done with your turn, but remember, you have a clock to manage.***Why do journalists moderate debates? They‚Äôre activists.***Just mute the person that is not speaking's mic, and have a computer read the questions.***Most journalists are staffers for the Biden campaign. They show daily they have no ethics or integrity.***I'm curious for people's thoughts on what kinds of people other than journalists should do it and also have at least some prominence?***Anyone see Cruz argue with Chris Cuomo? Cuomo is such a lying piece of shit.***Why is it always journalists? These people have no credibility.***How about use an automated moderator to ask the questions. 3 minutes per question. When time is up a loud beep plays and the microphone is muted.***something something JRE***Ted Cruz seems like a manipulative pastor who wants to pass around the collection basket.

Unless he tells me tomorrow that he is agnostic or atheist...I just cannot trust a goddamned thing he says.***Wallace didn't moderate anything. It's obvious he was siding with Biden and attacking Trump.***The next debate (if there is one) won‚Äôt be any better with Biden‚Äôs intern as the moderator. 

Best wishes to the President and First Lady for a speedy recovery.***Stick to town halls with only citizens get to ask questions and microphones shut on and off when its the persons turn. Who needs a moderator when both men are trying to run a country they can moderate themselves.***As a society, we have moved beyond the need for journalists***I agree with most of Trumps politics but the guy is not a conversationalist. 
That was awful.***The press in general has delusions of grandeur about their role in our republican form of government. They are not kingmakers, they are not referees, they are simply there to report the news. This whole fourth estate thing has to die.

Thoughts?***Well duh, can‚Äôt have people searching the ‚Äúwhite supremacist hate group‚Äù and finding their leader is a black man, that would make people question the narrative.***I made the mistake of scrolling through Facebook yesterday after months of not being on. I know this may be optimistic, but have any of the left psychos screeching white supremacy realized this group is made up of all races yet?? Or are they totally ignoring facts like always??***The best is when Liberals cry about racism allll day fucking long and they call groups like Proud Boys (who might I add are annoying imho) white supremacists yet you can go to Libya rn and buy a fucking human being in open air slave markets... poc being sold for cash to do whatever the fuck the buyer wants ... oh yeah and it's because of liberal gods Barack and Biden that this is happening lol ... yeah try bringing that up to a liberal when someone talks about systemic racism and orange man bad ... lol ...

He said that he wasn‚Äôt talking about Nazis when he said very fine people on both sides, but that doesn‚Äôt get headlines. The only reason that he didn‚Äôt denounce White Supremacy was because Chris Wallace used the Proud Boys or Kenosha militia groups as examples even though their actions were justifiable and much less violent than Antifa.***Wait... the fucking leader of Proud boys is an Afro-Cuban? That is hilarious, how are people so retarded as to label this group white supremacists?***So I'm not saying Tarrio is a white supremacist, but I want to clarify one thing to r/conservative: women can be biased against women, black people can discriminate against black people, and gay people can oppress other gay people.  Being black doesn't mean someone doesn't discriminate against black people.

One of the most surprising results of a lot of bias research is: the race/gender/whatever of the person discriminating against someone else *is not nearly as relevant as you would think.*  [Here's a concrete example](https://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474) (tl;dr female and male science faculty discriminate equally against a female applicant for a job)

(and the point I'm making is: the fact that Tarrio is black is irrelevant)***That group is pretty much all glow worms anyway.***Unless specifically conservative then everything is nearly extreme left. Didnt know that about reddit till now.***BREAKING:  Proud Boys witnessed marching to silicon valley***That‚Äôs racist***Xenophobia is a thing, y'all.***Lmao the salt is real***One less Uncle Tom I guess***What kind of shades are those?***I'm a liberal and didn't even hear about the Proud Boys until the debate. It's seems counter intuitive that a white supremacist group would be led by a black guy.

Can someone explain to be what the proud boys are, from a conservative perspective?***Why do you think he‚Äôs Black? He‚Äôs Latino from a Cuban family?***You guys sure do love your racism hmm.***Wait really? That is pretty ludicrous.***Woah , a black dude is the leader of a white supremacists group , who would've thought***Can't have him challenging the narrative.***anyone else find it hilarious the biggest media conglomerates are suppressing the far right and supporting the far left? what happened lmao?***Can someone explain what the Proud Boys are and do?

Ask me how i know***welcome to parler***https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_German_National_Jews***Good. His particular brand of supremacy is also unwelcome.***Of course they did....lol it won't make them go away. I wish they would though, because they aren't helping things....***ok make a new group and name it something different. Don't fight and let antifa do all the fighting. Watch them still denounce the new group and call antifa an idea lol***can a mod ban me from this subreddit so I can stop seeing it thanks I don‚Äôt want to see political related things lol***If you dont like twitter

But he really did score some points with moderate voters, that might have been concerned about his health.

j3g5xr,"***Wait, fans don't like being called racist? Shocking!***I love the excuses going on over at r/nba.

1. NFL, MLB playoffs.  Uhhh, I don't remember there being an NFL game going on last night but whatever.  The NBA finals also always competes against the MLB.  Granted this is the Wild Card round of the playoffs instead of the regular season, but the NBA is also normally competing against the NHL finals.

2. Everyone is illegally streaming!  Yep, and they were doing that last year too. 10 million people didn't decide to stop cable since last year.

3. No one cares about these teams.  Uh, it's the Lakers.  Literally the most popular NBA team in the world.

4.  There's no fans so it's not as interesting of a product.  Doesn't really seem to be affecting the NFL which had higher year over year ratings last week.

5. Refs/style of play.  You serious?  The NBA has been whistle happy since 2010.  

Get over yourselves.  No one is out doing things right now because of the pandemic.  You had the first game of your finals with your only competition MLB baseball, and you brought in *a third* of what you did last year.  The biggest measurable change is that the broadcast shoves insufferable woke politics down your throat 24/7.  **People do not want to watch that.**  I love basketball and even when my team isn't in it, I absolutely casually watch the playoffs.  Not this year.***In their defense, it was also the South Park Pandemic Special last night******The NBA forgot that SJW's don't watch sports.  They also don't spend money.  Or earn money.  

Really, why would anyone go after SJW's as a target market?***Wait. You mean the NBA finals are going on?? Do I care??***I love sports and I love basketball, it's my #2 favorite sport. I'm really not big on boycotting if I'm offended, I'll usually just shut up and watch anyways. But I got to be honest, I haven't warched one game ever since LeBron started talking. Maybe my subconscious is boycotting it***‚ÄúTune in tonight to be lectured about how white peoples and the police are devils‚Äù

Nope*** Basketball was my favorite sport But I stopped watching after this BLM bullshit started.  I don‚Äôt miss it either***What‚Äôs even more comical is Lebum trying so hard to impersonate the late Kobe Bryant, and literally rip a quote from Kobe when asked about the 1-0 lead. I‚Äôm sorry but Lebron is so cringeworthy and hung on himself. And the fact he mocks POTUS campaign slogan while he endorses China, is beyond sickening.

Go woke, go broke.***I almost wish I used to watch the NBA just so I could stop watching it now.***This is the first time in over 20 years I've refused to watch even a minute of playoff basketball.***Screw the racist nba.***The NBA should just move to China. The time difference is inconvenient for most of their audience.***I used to love watching the NBA. Now I have to choose between entertainment or honor. They over estimated their value to me. I am done with them...forever.***How many people watched Tucker or South Park?***Always consult the customer before making product changes.***Is this for all sports or just the ones that support BLM?***That‚Äôs rating sounds insane to me considering LA is in the finals with one of the best players in one of the biggest markets.

Message to the NBA:

You reap what you sow***I never watch the NBA. But after this wacky sports deprived spring and summer, I was actually going to try and watch some games in the bubble. After their ""strike"" over more bullshit narratives, I stopped watching entirely. Plus the product I did see just confirmed the reasons I never watched to begin with. The college game is a better product, with less political vomit.***Besides the obvious, the NBA is an entertainment league. They're not a fair sport anymore. Hard to retain fans when you know who's gonna win before game one***Why does the picture show Clark from the 100?***Keep it going!***Damn. Missed it. Oh well***I have season tickets to the Sixers and I didn‚Äôt even realize the NBA started. Of course I will laugh and say half of that is on the Sixers sucking, but the other half is that I have no interest in this stupid league at the moment. (Although I am still being charged every month as if they are going to pack the arena with 19,000 fans starting in December)***mmmmm I think people are just tired of seeing LAbron.***The fact the the NBA didn't stand with Hong Kong and now they're all about civil liberties posthumously after backlash is what pisses me off most.

Have an opinion, have a stance and take it.

You can't really pick and choose your core values depending on who's involved.***NBA is already in finals? Shows you how much I already didn't care for the sport.***When they added that trash on the back of the uniforms I ended my interest in the nba***I don't watch kneelers.***When in your lifetime has fox news outrated the nba***[You guys know these are just the numbers for one half the country, right??](http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/the-sked-wednesday-network-scorecard-9-30-2020.html)***They need to put the basketball game Picture in Picture on the lower right of the screen at quarter volume while BLM community leaders speak about systemic racism in American society and how whiteness is violence. That will help the NBAs ratings /s***To be fair there are other reasons that people aren't watching that contribute to the decline.

1) Miami heat shouldn't be there.  They're the 5th seed from the East.   Because of this, most casual viewers are assuming the Lakers will win the series easily.

2) The game last night was a blowout.  This does not attract the casual viewers.

3) The finals are being played in October during Football season and Baseball playoffs, which pulls viewership.

4) They are playing in ""The Bubble"".  It does not feel like an NBA Finals game because there is no crowd and the usual theatrics.

5) NBA League Pass is overpriced and junk.  Consider this along with Cord cutters.

The ""wokeness"" of the players and league is definitely a large contributing factor, but there are these reasons as well.***Good***They made their bed.***Fucking TASTY***Good***They're so woke they kneeled for the flag on 9/11***Nobody wants LeBron win.***I stopped watching the NBA once the NFL started.  I'm sure im not the only one.  Basketball for a lot of american fans is just something to watch when there's nothing else more important on.  I think the NBA over estimated how many people are actually in love with pro-basketball***Hopefully it gets lower than that. My only hope is that it actually gets lower than 1 million. Maybe these useless clowns will then understand who cuts their paychecks.***Holy shit that's trash. That's barely more than what Tucker Carlson pulls every single night

I'll admit as a sports fan that the ratings of all sports is down for multiple reasons, not just about going woke, but still that's part of why the NBA has such worse drop***If Biden wins and the woke take over people in this country with any wealth are going to regret that day.  They will first come for sports stars, Hollywood, Silicon Valley and Hedge Fund/C Level types and take their wealth.  Then they will come for the next levels to the point the person making $100K a year becomes tax  and asset poor while our government funds every failed ""social idea"" the woke can dream up.  Not to mention what bullshit like critical race theory that will split up our society.

The only saving grace might be that by 2024 our country will be in such a social and economic shitshow that the woke will be run out of existence.***I'm a former Lakers fan. I knew the second we signed LeBron, it was going to be drama and constant bitching, though I had no idea how terrible it would really come to be. I'll root for them again once he's gone,  but I'll be happy to see Quinn Cook get another ring if they win I guess***This whole sub needs a lesson on causation and correlation if they really think the expression of political viewpoints is detracting a significant number of viewers away from the NBA. The NHL final also only saw about 1/3 of its normal viewership. I hope people actually realize this and are just making these comments out of the fun of it***They can't just play sports, they have to grandstand!***You love to see it...***That's 5.3 million cowards who hate this country. Period.***Reap what you sow***Well, don‚Äôt bite the hand that feeds you***Didn‚Äôt even know it was going on already. Glad to see not too many people care. I‚Äôm sure it will be contributed to racism somehow.***10.7 million viewers last year. That's down by over 50%! Less than 12% viewership in Miami, and their team is in the championship. Trounced in the ratings so badly more people watched the Masked Singer, which is a really dumb af show. Players took a knee, and viewers took a pass.***Keep bowing to the CCP, LeBron. You‚Äôre spewing their garbage. You endorse an outfit whose leaders are clear Marxists and Voo Doo practitioners. Spiral down the drain, LeBron, and take in your Chinese money while slaves build your shoes and jerseys. Goodbye NBA***Big difference is this year has AD's eyebrow. It scared me away.***How does this compare to other sorts or views,? Stats mean nothing in a void.***Anyone tell me the Stanley Cup ratings?***is there any (non-anectodatal) evidence to this 'get woke go broke' statement?***It‚Äôs almost like nobody uses cable anymore.***The game was also a blowout***I'm out of the loop. What's up with the NBA right now?***I just looked it up and it‚Äôs said 7.4 million? Did you look at the pre west coast numbers?***Pretty sure league of legends worlds already has more viewers than this***Good, sports are a waste of money and resources.***Started boycotting NFL when the kneeling began. Began boycotting every other sport that decided to get politically involved.

Still watch some football though.***I personally wanted nuggets vs Heat for the lowest viewing possible***I thought The 100 was cancelled already.***This number doesn‚Äôt include the west coast numbers, when you add those, it‚Äôs actually 7.4 million. Regardless, I believe all sports are down this year.***Not only it is extremely woke, it is also extremely rigged . I stopped watching after the refs gave 3 fouls to each good denver player in the  first quarter vs the Lakers and became less real than the wwe
They are simply trying to write storylines for lebron at this point .***i'd like to see the miami marlins, san diego padres, and oakland athletics tv ratings for mlb playoff games that day before coming to a conclusion. because those three teams would definitely take a good amount of viewership base from the nba finals game.***Good.  I haven‚Äôt watched any sports games this year.  I use entertainment to get away from the shit show that is reality.  I don‚Äôt need that shit dragged out into my entertainment.***It‚Äôs hard to watch basketball when it‚Äôs football season***Good riddance racist NBA.***Just to add to this topic - I feel like the matchup this year isn‚Äôt as exciting as past years. Yes the lakers are good, but the Heat are a 5 seed. Also the lack of crowd presence makes the games look less professional***Probably has less to do with the politics and more to do with the teams playing. Just saying***What is the NBA?***I could not care less about team sports, let them enjoy their wokeness.***it's also one of the most lopsided matchups in finals history***That 5.3 mil is still 50 times more than CNN's best night. When the fans quit coming, they put cardboard cutouts up.  When the advertisers quit, they will be replaced by globalist money players, like Soros and the Clinton Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates, the CCP etc.***Good i hope these clowns go bankrupt and have to work like the rest of us!***I used to love the lakers, fuck lebron I hope they lose, but probably won‚Äôt, even then still fuck lebron and the woke nba.***I‚Äôm more impressed there were 630k people watching The 100.***Do you think the NBA didn't expect this?   
Do you think the players would have stuck around the league if they didn't come to an agreement? That would kill the business entirely.***Crazy. I wonder what their ratings would be without fans in the stadium?***Cool. Lakers in 4!***Sports leagues live in conservatives heads rent free.

I've never once looked up the ratings for anything on tv, whether I love or hate it. It's just because Trump is obsessed with ratings.

Probably won't tune in this year.

It's also going up against the NFL which doesn't usually happen.

It's already backfired, it's a real honest humanizing glimpse of a First Lady that has been falsely portrayed as cold and unfeeling *at best.* It raises the Obama border policies and the media's role in lying by omission. It proves that even in secret she fully supports her husband (debunking the Leftist conspiracy theory that she actually despises him).

It helps children partake in a form of civic duty and puts spotlights on groups helping children.***I actually think this makes her look fucking awesome? I don't really have an opinion on Melania one way or the other, she's been a largely peripheral figure throughout the last four years, but this candid quality of her indicates she's far more aware and astute than most give her credit for. I wish she'd been out there more in a more combative role. 

It's a refreshing moment of candor for a first lady, one we rarely get to see. It clearly shows her frustration with the double standard of the expected duty of the first lady, and yet their simultaneous social responsibility for their husbands politics. While Obama was droning wedding parties in the middle east, or deporting the very same families that now serve as fodder for righteous Pulitzer chasers, Michelle was on Ellen dancing and slaying in Balenciaga boots. Michelle had no power over those decisions yet she received no flack because the media barely have any to her husband.

This administration has been a fly magnet for ugly people like this. 

And then of course, Anderson Cooper looking worse than perhaps her for becoming in short time a glorified tabloid journalist. This is a man who used to cover war zones and has had immense wealth and privelege benefit him into the position and platform he has.

So, my guess here is that if the doctor says Trump is going to keep working, he‚Äôs probably pretty healthy.

Maybe asymptomatic at this time since they did say hope hicks was symptomatic.

Optimistically,

* For his age, he‚Äôs got a 95% chance of living

* For his weight, that makes it worse

* Because they caught it so early, I think the treatments have advanced enough where catching it early is a good thing and can be treated more effectively

* He‚Äôs got top notch doctors


It‚Äôs also possible he‚Äôs asymptomatic or have a low viral load as other users have said they see him wearing a mask when he‚Äôs off camera.  And if he follows guidelines on the plane, then Hope would have worn a mask, too.

All those are pretty good things.

On the downside, Trump tries to keep people optimistic.  But I hope he actually shares the real data with the public

Starting with the Washington Post:

https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1311904974532567040***We're gonna beat this sucker, come out the other side stronger, and then beat Biden in November.

TRUMP 2020***Again, incoming r/politics brigade.  Look at the awards they give, laughing and hoping for his death.  This is many on the left.  Never would I wish COVID-19 on Joe Biden or any political figure on the left.  I pray every single day that those infected find a speedy path to recovery.  I am disgusted by what so much of this country has become. As a millennial, I am disgusted at the weakness, fragility, hatred, and inability to accept personal responsibility of my generation.  Excuse my language, but what the fuck happened.

And to those on the left who claim Trump is evil/Hitler reincarnated so their actions are justified... this was a trend, nay, a BELIEF indoctrinated in our public education and general social life FAR before Trump was elected.  Bush was called a Nazi, too.  I remember my father telling me, when I was much younger, not to ever discuss politics in school or at work.  That it was a quick way to get a target on your back.  This hatred has been slowly infecting our country for over a decade and probably more.  It is disgusting and I'm so tired of the pure hatred that oozes from leftist's pores.

Wishing death on someone for ideological reasons?  Pathetic and sickening.  That's like on the same level as people who abuse animals for fun.  Finding joy in someone or something else's pain is psychotic.

*Edit - I want to be clear that this is not everyone on the left.  There are still good people on both sides.  We should be unified in condemning this kind of behavior.***I give my prayers to the recovery of not only Donald and Melania, but also Hope Hicks and any others who may be dealing with this infection right now.

As someone who lives in a hotbed area, I'd like to know what treatment they receive.  My biggest complaint about Trump is his downplay of COVID and the ""solutions"" he's touted on air.  Will he be subjecting himself and his family to Hydroxychloroquine?  If no, why was he pushing it for so long?  Should my mother take Hydroxychloroquine?  If Trump won't, why should my mother?

I think everybody deserves to know what care he receives on the American tax dime, and that same treatment should be made available to everybody.******99% of the rest of Reddit - ""HAHAHAHA, DRUMPF BAD!""***Man these awards creep me out, feels like a celebration. Reddit is a strange place. At anyrate I am praying for POTUS and FLOTUS. I know a lot of people hate him but I think he honestly did the very best job he could have with this Covid 19 pandemic. It was certainly not perfect but to try to blame him for 200k deaths is very sick. I hope people can maybe see that now.***I'm left leaning but would never wish a positive test on any individual. Also The last thing America needs right now is the death of a sitting president.

But the left media better be careful how they attack trump on this. They may end up turning many people off with their comments.***POTUS will be fine. I am not worried about him or the FLOUS at all.

WEAR YOUR MASKS, SOCIAL DISTANCE, AND WASH YOUR HANDS!!!***They want him to die because to them it's poetic justice. They are the very thing they hate. It's been encouraged by the media, and a stunning low in our political discourse. When you peddle in conspiracy theories and parnaoid ravings about the virus and ""Trump killing Americans"", this is the kind of tribalism you get. As I saw it put clearly a few days ago,

""Trump won't be president one day. After he isn't, what will you be?""***This could end up being an October Surprise. He said he‚Äôs been taking HCQ a while back. What if his positive test turns out to be absolutely nothing? The media then has to admit that some of the hype has been overblown, right?

Btw, this may cancel the next debate. It was scheduled for Oct 15, and that‚Äôs just at the end of the 2 week quarantine. 

Oh, and everyone cheering for him to die from this is just an evil soul. I didn‚Äôt like Obama, but I never wished him ill. Cannot stand Pelosi, but again, just wish she‚Äôd retire into a quiet, private life, not die. 

This event really exposes the true nature of a lot of people.

Check my post history in here, I have lots of karma and share many of the same opinions you do. 

With that said, the eternal cynic in me thinks President Trump doesn‚Äôt actually have COVID and this is a ploy for:

1) Sympathy, since this is pretty much the only way he can get it without something truly awful happening (e.g., one of his kids or FLOTUS passing)

2) A way out of the debate on October 15, since he‚Äôll have to be quarantined (it‚Äôs within 14 days)

3) A way to show his relative vitality compared to Biden and downplay COVID, as he won‚Äôt get symptoms despite being elderly and overweight

I realize this is cynical and probably even conspiratorial. I‚Äôm not usually the latter, but I think the debate went so badly for him the other night that Trump thinks he has to do something radical to change his fortunes.

Why has he spent insane amounts of $$ trying to find a treatment and vaccines?

He said impeachment was a hoax, and then started talking about covid the next sentence.

It‚Äôs getting exhausting.***This and god forbid something worse happens is going to bring the worst out in Americans. We take politics way too seriously when it comes to judging people.

On the plus side, this could give him a bit of a much-needed sympathy boost.

Trump has been taking this very serious from the start and has been relying on experts like Fauci to spearhead the response to Covid-19. Why would he do any of that if he thinks it's not real? 

It looks like Dems need to be reminded of how their own precious leaders were behaving when covid first hit the US, it was nothing but dismissing how serious the situation was and they were encouraging people to go outside when they shouldn't. Isn't it convenient how they can pick and choose which bits of information to consider true or false, and how these bits of information always fit their narrative? 

The mental gymnastics involved in modern American politics is nauseating.

As an aside, it now appears that the narrative on reddit is that conservatives we happy when RBG died and that we were celebrating what happened to her. That isn't even remotely true. This sub was full of nothing but respect. Again, they're attempting to rewrite history. This kind of behavior is extremely dangerous. It's like they're trying to force a 1984-esque world on us. I just hope your average American is sharp enough to notice what's happening.***What the fuck is that headline?

Jesus and God will protect us from any Danger! Trump 2020***Here's an excerpt from a [recent editorial](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6510/1409?rss=1) in the journal Science.

'When President Donald Trump began talking to the public about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in February and March, scientists were stunned at his seeming lack of understanding of the threat. We assumed that he either refused to listen to the White House briefings that must have been occurring or that he was being deliberately sheltered from information to create plausible deniability for federal inaction. Now, because famed Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward recorded him, we can hear Trump‚Äôs own voice saying that he understood precisely that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was deadly and spread through the air. As he was playing down the virus to the public, **Trump was not confused or inadequately briefed: He flat-out lied**, repeatedly, about science to the American people. These lies demoralized the scientific community and cost countless lives in the United States. Over the years, this page has commented on the scientific foibles of U.S. presidents. Inadequate action on climate change and environmental degradation during both Republican and Democratic administrations have been criticized frequently. Editorials have bemoaned endorsements by presidents on teaching intelligent design, creationism, and other antiscience in public schools. These matters are still important. But now, a U.S. president has deliberately lied about science in a way that was imminently dangerous to human health and directly led to widespread deaths of Americans. This may be the most shameful moment in the history of U.S. science policy.'",-0.14304955,0.229501803,0.479063465,Negative,"NYTimes Admits WHO's Decision Not To Close Borders At Start Of Pandemic Was Based On ""Politics"", Not Science.

You aren't likely aren't going to die or get seriously ill although I'll admit Trump's age and obesity won't help.  But far likely he just needs to rest for a few days and take some over the counter medicine.  In other words what people have always done for a cold.

Now the COVID 19 hysteria left will run wild.  You can see how they will have every justification of locking down the world again but now Trump has COVID.  This is the problem with testing, the MSM and Karen's are conflating a positive test result or even someone with mild symptoms to someone that will need hospitalization and will eventually die.

I'd like to take a shot at reasonably expressing why I'm at all positive about this news. Before I do that, I'd also like to acknowledge that there are a bunch of twats on the internet that have no idea how to express themselves other than regurgitating bile at ""the enemy.""

Personally, I'm feeling torn. My conscience is causing me some negative affect and sympathy for his family. I don't think I'm wired to celebrate any kind of illness or death.

However, I'll admit that I'm feeling optimistic over the diagnosis. One of the biggest things that kills me about Trump is how he's enabled others to turn masks and taking the virus seriously into a partisan issue. I can provide many examples, but the two that stick out to me is that [as recently as the debate, he belittled Biden for wearing masks and for whatever reason felt the need to point out that initially, the jury was split on masks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKTknVUIdhQ&ab_channel=WUSA9). The second is the decision to hold indoor rallies above recommended capacity where many people don't wear masks.

So, what I'm hoping comes out of this is a change in the narrative/level of caution around COVID. Yes, Trump in my opinion is enabling the politicizing of caution around COVID, but a lot of the blame has to fall to those being reckless and endangering others. I'm hoping that the reckless people will take this diagnosis as a wake up call. This is where being reckless lands you.

I'm sure there are many others that feel this way, but are choosing to express their feelings through vitriol and treating political parties like they're sports teams. Many people, myself included, have a lot of pent up anger over people being reckless about this illness and so this is a bit of a catharsis. Unfortunately, this being the internet, that's not always going to be expressed in the most positive fashion.***My conservative opinions even get downvoted on /r/conservative

She said she hopes that intolerance of homosexuality will become a disqualifier. The exchange that happened before that shows that she recognizes orthodox forms of these religions still hold regressive views towards homosexuality. However, she never says that religious views should be disqualifying, or that the regressive views are held by all people who follow any of the named religions.

As someone who sees so much potential for good in religious belief, I find it offensive to suggest that being anti-homosexual is somehow a fundamental tenet of these religions, and without that they wouldn't exist. But that is the only logical way to get from what she actually said to what the headline implies she said. Since those weren't her words, I think the much more accurate interpretation would be ""I am not against religious views generally, only some orthodox dogma specifically."" Probably most people here feel the same. I mean, that's how we got the protestant reformation.

Finally, even if she had said that, I think it's deliberately misleading to point to specific problematic staffers on a campaign employing thousands because it implies their views are shared by the candidate.

But, to be fair, Trump did call fear around COVID-19 a hoax on multiple occasions.  And while most here understood that he was not suggesting it was fake, many others did (I've met plenty).

He can be criticized for communicating poorly.  But to relish in his past language in light of his diagnosis, is just stupid.  He always believed in it.***

One liberal, and one conservative, they weaponized the news and created the world we live in today.  Those two people are Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch. 

Turner invented a news network that aired for 24hours without enough content to sustain that period of time, and that led to punditry shows and bullshit sensationalist stories, as well as the lowering of standards as to what constitutes news.  

Rupert discovered that you can market to a specific group and line up advertisers that cater to their interests.  Once he started doing that, the others followed suit.

Fuck those guys.***Have you noticed that when you listen to main stream news stories,  the presenters use that grade school teacher voice that sounds like they are talking to children?***Chris Wallace is no Mike Wallace***In this situation it wasn't the bias of the media that was the problem - it was letting the biased media dictate what constitutes ""neutral"" in the forum on Presidential debates. Anyone with half a brain could tell Chris Wallace wasn't a neutral moderator, and the next one in the queue was a Biden staffer.

The issue isn't that we need to ""fix"" media companies that are owned and operated for corrupt purposes - they are hopeless. The issue is that we have to stop giving credibility to groups that have a painfully obvious track record of partisan conduct. It's just as bad as letting the SPLC decide who is and isn't a ""hate group.""

If they are pretending to be objective and fair, yet are all in for one side *that* is an issue. As it is deceptive and dishonest. 

A good media would strive to be fair, while also recognizing their own bias. The same would be said of a justice. There are specific professional positions where you strive for the ideal while also recognizing you are only human.

How about today‚Äôs trending tweets calling for Trumps death? You guys could not be more hypocritical. Take your bs elsewhere please.

And no, we did not celebrate RGB's death, go look at the thread on this sub. Use your eyes, and then your brain. Good luck.

And to you clowns saying that, ""obese"" is just a medical term, here is how your House Speaker used this medical term, ""As far as the President is concerned, he's our President and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group -- morbidly obese, they say. So, I think it's not a good idea."" Funny, the CDC does not have a category for ""morbidly obese."" THAT is not a medical term. That is making fun of fat people. That is not a class act.

Obviously the sexual assault is a concern, but seems like he‚Äôd be a good mentor or uncle. Wouldn‚Äôt mind hanging with Biden.

From John Adams to Massachusetts Militia, 11 October 1798
To the Officers of the first Brigade of the third Division of the Militia of Massachusetts
Quincy October 11. 1798

Gentlemen,
I have received from Major General Hull and Brigadier General Walker your unanimous Address from Lexington, animated with a martial Spirit and expressed with a military Dignity, becoming your Characters and the memorable Plains, in which it was adopted.

While our Country remains untainted with the Principles and manners, which are now producing desolation in so many Parts of the World: while she continues Sincere and incapable of insidious and impious Policy: We shall have the Strongest Reason to rejoice in the local destination assigned Us by Providence. But should the People of America, once become capable of that deep simulation towards one another and towards foreign nations, which assumes the Language of Justice and moderation while it is practicing Iniquity and Extravagance; and displays in the most captivating manner the charming Pictures of Candour frankness & sincerity while it is rioting in rapine and Insolence: this Country will be the most miserable Habitation in the World. Because We have no Government armed with Power capable of contending with human Passions unbridled by morality and Religion. Avarice, Ambition, Revenge or Galantry, would break the strongest Cords of our Constitution as a Whale goes through a Net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.

An Address so unanimous and firm from the officers commanding two thousand Eight hundred Men, consisting of such substantial Citizens as are able and willing at their own Expence, compleatly to arm, And cloath themselves in handsome Uniforms does honor to that Division of the Militia which has done so much honor to their Country. Oaths, in this Country, are as yet universally considered as Sacred Obligations. That which you have taken and so solemnly repeated on that venerable Spot is an ample Pledge of your sincerity, and devotion to your Country and its Government.

For them. Sincerely Chicago person on lockdown still***bUt tRuMP***I personally have never had a problem with masks because if it helps stop the spread that means the more we can reopen. I am actually very disappointed that even something like masks has been turned into a political idea. A nationwide mask mandate would NOT be helpful, simply because America is just too big for it all the be dictated by one mandate. NYC needs far different rules then rural Wyoming does.

Just my opinion though***This is like putting your umbrella away because you aren't getting wet. Masks fight the spread of covid. Some people will just not wear masks without the mandates. Getting rid of the mandate, will increase the spread of Covid. This is guaranteed.

The masks have been one of the few things that have been able to help the confirmed cases number go down (along with people simply choosing to not get tested of course).***I haven't worn a mask in months.

And don't even get me started on the 95% of people wearing poorly-fitting masks, masks under their nose, or masks with exhaust valves. It's all just theater.

Surgeons and dentists wear masks to prevent their spittle from going directly into a patient's open wound/mouth. Paper/cloth masks were never intended to be used as a prophylactic for respiratory viral spread because they DON'T WORK THAT WAY. They don't filter the air you breathe. That would be a respirator.

> ""Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one's first feeling, 'Thank God, even they aren't quite so bad as that,' or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies are as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally we shall insist on seeing everything -- God and our friends and ourselves included -- as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred.""

If you asked me last week how Rachel Maddow would have reacted if she heard Trump got COVID, I'd have guessed she would have some passive-aggressive pleasure in it, or make some snarky comment, or try to turn it into an ""I told you so"" moment and play politics with it.

They have become so big tent they are basically housing 2 sperate political parties.  A left of Center party and a Centrist party.

Before I say more, please read the whole post before jumping to a conclusion. Yes this is an idea currently being pushed like Progressives like Warren but its worth considering.

Right now everything in politics is binary and it‚Äôs hard to find someone that won‚Äôt agree there is a problem, the disagreement is on who is causing it as everyone screams ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the other side‚Äù. There should be many parties that form coalitions in Congress to pass bills. This would be fundamentally different than countries with parliamentary systems as there would still be an executive branch. Theoretically if no one party has a majority everything will need multiple party consensus, but it could change based on the topic. As the parties would have a different stance on different issues, the various consensus policy would better reflect the electorate whereas now ~50% will be pissed.

To get there people would need to not feel that voting for a third party would be wasting your vote. That‚Äôs what makes Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) IMO a great change to the current system. So looking forward to other opinions but check them out on r/rankthevote as well***This is a danger in Taiwan as well, but we accept it because the conservative party in our country is literally colliding with the CCP.***I think if he continues going down his road, then yes - people will eventually wake up and vote the GOPs out.***Im skeptical this is such a threat. Currently rep. Hold both congress and the white house(correct me if im wrong, not american), and looking at us politics it seems natural that it swings back and forth quite heavily. From reagan to clinton, clinton to bush, bush to obama and obama to trump

I think the two party system is fine. American democracy is fairly safe. The intresesting possibility in my mind is a viable third party emerging.***I'm confused.  Is the article saying American territories don't deserve government representation simply because Trump believes they will be liberals?***he says as he packs the courts with conservative judges and demonizes the other in every possible sentence. we will have a one party system after trump because no one will trust conservative candidates for years after this mess.

edit: when trump does it its filling vacant seats, when biden does it its PACKING THE COURTS!!1!1  yall are fuckin stupid and it shows.***> And they are also going to add two or three new states. I heard Guam and two others that you mentioned (D.C. and Puerto Rico), as you know. That would give them six automatic Senate seats, automatic, no chance. Just, it would be very unfair.

The Senate as it's currently instituted is ""very unfair"". Because the Republican party is mostly a rural party and there are more rural states, they have a majority of the Senate with a minority of the population.

If you combine the 14, 16, and 18 vote totals, the Democrats received 20 million more votes to get six less seats.

538 called it a six to seven percent built-in advantage.

If anything adding a couple mostly Democratic states would make things fair.

Given current demographic shifts the Republican party as it ideologically exists today won't survive for another 10 or 20 years.

We do not like it when people hit children, but laugh about videos of kids getting themselves hurt. It is not the principal of ""hurt kid = bad"" it is the natural thing to separate causing pain and being hurt because of one's own actions. Similarly, learning that someone was kidnapped and trapped in a basement for 15 years is not the same as someone comitting a crime and being locked up for 15 years. We as a society justify violence all the time, if we think the person deserves it.


If people on the left believe Trump is the *cause* of the virus (as some do) then him getting it is both karma, and justification for their views that he does not take it seriously enough (mask/rallies/etc). They believe he caused the deaths, so he ""deserves"" it. While many here might disagree with that logic, let us not pretend like anyone agrees that harm can never be justified, only that desiring harm in this situation is not justified.

Both these personalities are hardly comparable. I don‚Äôt think anyone regardless of politics can find anything but pure respect for RBG since she has kind of an unblemished record. 


Trump on the contrary is a very controversial public person to say the least. To a lot of the left  probably the worst kind of person, and that‚Äôs before the pandemic even began. 

Trump has repeatedly downplayed the virus, made fun of it and refused to take the right measures when thousands of people started dying. Indirectly causing the loss of A LOT of Americans on his Watch. That‚Äôs just truth and trying to find excuses for shitty decisions by him is pointless.

I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs right to wish harm on another person, but I just want to give the perspective that these persons are just not comparable in a lot of aspects. RBG can certainly be considered a Champion for both sides. 

Reddit has shown this kind of apathy or rather glee for misfortune in the past for other personalities, one i personally remember is the death of a pharma industry mogul basically singlehandedly responsible for various crazily inflated medicines. Little love was shown. 

And real talk, i am sure this sub has various persons they wouldn‚Äôt feel the loss either, even if the impact of that might not be as immense as Donald‚Äôs. 

Lets be real few people truly think anything more serious is gonna result from this for POTUS and Co.. they have state of the art equipment and specialists that are available 100% for them alone. 

It‚Äôs a malicious joy for the suffering of a person that in half of the countries eyes is responsible for a lot of shit. 

I guess it‚Äôs like seeing someone fall on their face. 

RGB is the good girl everybody likes. 
Trump is the bully who is thick with one half of the class and disliked a lot by everybody else. And he has repeatedly made fun of everybody else stumbling.***I know there are a lot of great people out there that are liberals, but you won't find them on r/politics***Im as moderate as it gets but come on now. Everyone who uses Reddit knows there was bad comments on both topics. I could just as easily select 20 bad ones from right wing people on RBG and 20 good ones about Trump getting COVID and post a identical picture but skewing the other way.

There is shit people on both sides. Trying to frame it as us vs them morality is asinine.***I'd be tempted to cross-post this to r/Democrats and other Democratic subs, to see if it doesn't finally hit home for them. To hell with the downvotes. See what they can possibly respond with and still claim to call themselves reasonable.

The Republican reaction to RBJ's death also came to mind quickly when I heard the news and observed the Democrats' reactions. I remember seeing both of these threads/comment sets too, among many others similar.***Not a great comparison because RBG wasn't a polarizing personality. But I can think of many many democrats that would have their misfortunes highly celebrated in certain subs.***It's not quite like for like though, RBG didn't spend months denying the seriousness of pancreatic cancer and oversee a state response that lead to 200,000 us citizens and counting to die from the disease. 

Also, this *very* much looks like cherry picked data to me.***Why even block out their names unless thats a rule?***This experience is so instructive.  There is something about the leftist mindset and being prone to hate.  Not just dislike, but ingrained, vicious, vitriolic hate.  Of anything and anyone that disagrees, that does not align, that does not bend the knee, denies a narrative or worst of all....tells the truth.***There‚Äôs a pretty big difference between contracting a virus that he (and yall) have repeatedly stated is not likely to be deadly and . . .

If you give class, in most cases you get class back.***RBG is a respectable person from both sides.

Trump is controversial even on his own base.

This is normal***Some girl on my facebook posted ""Finally some good news"" about trump getting covid. This is just how they are******Pretty easy to make any point you want if you can cherry pick evidence üôÉ***None of the highlighted comments on r/politics are out of line. Many of you keep your head in the sand about all the lies trump said about covid which contributed to the death of hundreds of thousand. Even at the start of the week he was mocking Biden for wearing a mask constantly. That's fucking KARMA right there and it's well diserved.

Comparing a no empathy narcissist like Trump to a fighter for civil liberties like RBG is almost as insane as people believing they have a higher moral ground after all we've witness since Trump got elected and you still support him. Get real.***While anyone actually wishing his death can fuck off, these are two very different situations. RBG died of cancer complications, while Trump has contracted a virus that he has been spending months down playing and mocked his opponent for how serious he takes it just days ago. A vast majority of the comments on the right of this picture are making jokes because that is exactly how Trump has been treating this pandemic. While the majority of this sub takes offense to these jokes, the other sub feels Karma has finally hit. Also Trumps mockery of Hilary being sick last election cycle doesnt help. 

Im sure all this has been said here already but it seems pretty obvious how these two events are completely different***I tried to post a link of this on r/politics. A bot took down my post almost instantly.***For any who pass by

The post *isn‚Äôt a comparison of the two individuals* that are being commented on, it‚Äôs about *the people making the comments*. By this post, you can see that the users within /r/Conservative had been respectful within their comments about RGB‚Äôs death. On the other hand, users within /r/Politics seem to have no sympathy for Trump after contracting Covid-19 and even specifically say they hope Covid-19 wins in this case. This evidence shows the level of common decency both sides have towards each other‚Äôs political members, and I would say that the users of /r/Conservative have more of it than the users of /r/Politics***You have asked us not to care about people making minimum wage. 

You have asked us not to care about people who can't afford medicine.

You have asked us not to care about children in cages. 

You have asked us not to care about women being sterilized. 

You have *demanded* that we not care about people being unjustly killed by police. 

Don't ask us to care now.******Zero morals on the left anymore***It‚Äôs hilarious to see all these socialists spending money on gold***A lotta top-flight Republicans getting Covid lately, and not many Democrats***They really are vile creatures***Well, I'm not surprised, the left is disgusting.

Also, if anyone was curious about my consistency on the topic, here's the statement I made on RBG when it was announced, it can be found in my comment history:

> I might disagree with her views, but I hope she rests in peace and her family is ok.***""Do as i say not as i do""  - Liberals******Nicely cherry picked. Well done.***Nobody hates like the left***Lol, one is dead and one has a virus he has not taken seriously. Yep, looks like apples to apples to me. 

Now, if the president dies from this, and the left has nasty things to say that‚Äôs a different story. 

Also, the people who wish death on the president are idiots plain and simple.***I wonder how they feel about the 200,000+ people who have died.. I wonder if they think they ‚Äúdeserved it‚Äù.***Unblock those usernames. Immorality has consequences***Really? Cherry picking comments? There's shitty comments on both threads as well as respectful ones. People like you just cause more division.***I like how people on reddit are now also trying to make us uncomfortable with the gay proud boy posts lol. Like they really think we're going to have a meltdown over people loving each other.***So high

In a just world, these people would not have power.***When did conservatives become such snow flakes about jokes? One person died the other is experiencing mild symptoms that he told the country he is supposed to protect is no big deal. If it's no big deal why does anyone care? It only kills old people I thought...***There‚Äôs really no way to claim superior decorum and the moral high ground if you‚Äôve been supporting Trump for the past few years***Uh one was a death and the other isn't. Totally different. 

And tbh the Trump comments are pretty hilarious. Come on, you have to admit the humor in it. Trump tells the country that it's a hoax to not cause panic apparently, goes around not wearing a mask and not enforcing social distancing at his rallies, downplays the virus this entire time, then gets corona. That's funny as shit. 

That being said, not everyone on the left wishes death upon Trump. I personally wish prison but never death. That's extreme.***Liberals are monsters.

So he was saying Dems were trying to create a false the impression his administration was failing to manage Covid. Comparatively, as a country we certainly didn't handle the virus well, but I get that Dems would want to make the Trump administration take the blame for it.

IMO, his downplaying of the disease (It'll go away with warm weather, only the seriously ill/elderly are at risk, etc) certainly played into how Lassez-faire states were about creating policies for Covid. In addition, those state policies didn't mean much when the states that had no policy still allowed free travel to at risk zones like NYC and LA. The lack of a clear plan from the White House and conflicting reports from leadership stuttered our preparations and ruined a lot of the good initiatives that were taken to mitigate things. So no, he didn't call Corona a hoax. But I don't believe he treated it seriously.

And since there are no source links,

Source: https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-virus-outbreak-ap-fact-check-politics-joe-biden-1eea443cca46df5f18e61b7c34549da2******Why is the question of whether or not he called the virus a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù relevant? He said as recently as September that it would disappear, made fun of Biden for wearing a mask a few days ago, and admitted to downplaying it. It‚Äôs also clear now that his campaign requested that the debate moderator not mention the number 200,000. 

It‚Äôs not true that he stopped travel from China. It‚Äôs impossible to prove what a Democrat would or wouldn‚Äôt have done, and impossible to prove that there would be more deaths under a Democrat. 

I‚Äôm sitting here wondering why y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt pushing for someone reasonable to lead the conservatives into a new era. Trump ain‚Äôt it.***Hey I‚Äôm not one to argue a moot point here but seriously. Here‚Äôs the whole speech, February 29th 2020. https://youtu.be/NbwCjL7HC1c

Part in question is within the first 5 minutes. He calls the impeachment a hoax, and says ‚Äúthis is their new hoax‚Äù. Specifically referring to the virus and then goes into the 15 people we had infected at the time and how great of a job we were doing.

I mean, this is just straight up bullshit. Stop lying to yourselves.***This must be the ""October Surprise""  -- Snopes got something right!***Quick, someone tell AOC!***https://youtu.be/fUNrXN9XC2k

People don't research and just listen so its easy to be influenced.***Yeah he definitely didn't call the virus a hoax. I mean, his wording was definitely unfortunate, he can't have expected that line to not play poorly. Just one of those things that requires context, like Biden ""forgetting the pledge of allegiance"".***The fact that he suspended international trade and travel to one of our biggest trading partners on January 29th. Something that hasn't been done before in usa history. I'm pretty sure those couple of days before February kinda show that he took it seriously. February was when Pelosi called the suspension racist and said covid-19 was nothing more than a simple flu. She even went to Chinatown and urged everyone to join her.***Ummmm.... ngl guys he directly called it a hoax.

Articles like this spreading just helps the left. Come on.***The amount of word twisting the media has done the last 4 years is absolutely astonishing.***Now they can claim their fact checking is unbiased.***Snopes said it was mixed not false as their assessment. I think that's just only because Trump kinda muddles along when he give speeches and can occasionally go off the rails:

*""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They‚Äôre politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‚ÄòHow‚Äôs President Trump doing?‚Äô They go, ‚ÄòOh, not good, not good.‚Äô They have no clue. They don‚Äôt have any clue. They can‚Äôt even count their votes in Iowa, they can‚Äôt even count. No they can‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt count their votes.*

*One of my people came up to me and said, ‚ÄòMr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn‚Äôt work out too well. They couldn‚Äôt do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they‚Äôve been doing it since you got in. It‚Äôs all turning, they lost, it‚Äôs all turning. Think of it. Think of it.* ***And this is their new hoax.*** *But you know, we did something that‚Äôs been pretty amazing. We‚Äôre 15 people \[cases of coronavirus infection\] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.""*

Don‚Äôt forget that.***I'm entirely convinced that if Trump had come out stronger in favor of masks back in April, Liberals would suddenly give a shit about the actual science behind them. They'd be telling us nonstop masks are a false sense of security, pointing out how the states with high mask usage don't see decreased transmission rates, telling us all about the 120nm virus size and how masks don't stop that, talking about air circulation more, etc.

And if you have any doubt... They went on about Vaccines for months. Until Trump said he was getting close to one. And now Democrats are anti-vax.

As if Trump has anything to do with developing or distributing them, and the FDA hasn't been regulating these things for decades.***Since when have facts mattered for the left.

I've seen a few defense experts talking about this on Twitter, and I'm sure we'll eventually get a better description of what it actually is.  According to those experts this protocol was agreed to months ago should the President get COVID, and this could be directly from that.  Not because he needs inpatient care.

Edit:  Found an article finally on this:  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8800181/Inside-Walter-Reed-Trump-treated-coronavirus-secure-Presidential-Suite.html***He looked like himself walking to and from Marine One. Prayers for the president and shame on anyone cheering for him to get worse.*****Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days,‚Äù Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany says in a statement.**

It‚Äôs logistically better for him to be at Walter Reed if he has some symptoms and if he wants to get better quickly. They have an entire team of doctors and nurses there, with every available drug in the world to ease his discomfort. He could have that at the White House too, but it‚Äôs much easier and logistically better to have him there. Have faith, everyone. Trump will beat this and come out stronger than ever! Don‚Äôt let the miserable left get to you. POTUS has gone through every single obstacle thrown at him throughout his tenure, and I have faith he will get through this as well.

Edit: meant ‚Äúcome‚Äù not ‚Äúcoke‚Äù***I am not a conservative. But I want him to get better. There needs to be a fair election in 2020 and he needs to get better to either win or lose.***Trump better be have those continuing of government conversations right now. He needs a plan of what medical threshold of when he transfers power temporary to Pence. 

Pence needs to isolate and be ready to be acting president.***In my heart, I think most Americans understand that the President is in grave danger, and that this moment calls for our shared humanity, not for politics. Social media does not represent either party.

From a Biden supporter to President Trump, his family, and his supporters, I have no commentary to offer other than my unqualified prayers, positive energy, and sincere hopes for his quick recovery.***He tweeted approximately 20 minutes ago: https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1312158400352972800?s=21***People are celebrating this. If you're calling anyone's illness a good thing/deserved/etc., with very few exceptions, you're human scum. End of story.***Get well soon Mr president. Smart decision being at a great medical center like Walter Reed. Hopefully he'll be feeling better in a couple of days.***> rule 6 misleading title

If Trump could have avoided going, he would have.***Shit******I got permanently banned from r/news last night for simply saying I wished trump and Melania well. It was classified as ‚Äútrolling‚Äù and then the moderator muted me for 28 days. Lol. Cowardly. 

Sad how many people are happy about this. You can disagree with people but wishing ill or harm on them is just sad.***Hospitalized is highly disingenuous.  He walked to Marine One under his own power to stay at his personal suite at Walter Reed as a precaution.***Hey first off id like to say from the left we hope Trump does end up okay its a hard time for our country and shame on all the Dems laughing and wishing bad on Trump, hes not my favorite person but hes human none the less.And we need to move past partisanship and hope he's okay at the end.

But I also have a question and ive asked this in other subs trying to figure out the answer. If Donald does make it who runs against Biden in the election? I hope it doesn't come to that ,but it has me concerned with November right around the corner ?***A little reminder for those pretending trump would treat an opponent diagnosed with covid with any grace or compassion. So much virtue signaling in this thread. https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-imitates-clinton-stumbling-while-ill-with-pneumonia/2016/10/02/e5dce8d4-8887-11e6-8cdc-4fbb1973b506_video.html***Anything on his symptoms are going to be speculative. Nobody will release what his actual symptoms are due to National Security. 

Really hoping he gets released next week or we get an update Sunday saying he‚Äôs symptom free and will stay there for monitoring and a negative test.***Thoughts and prayers to the president, FLOTUS, and family. 

Why are the top comments (positive comments from non Trump supporters) collapsed? They have positive upvotes as well?***Honestly, what happened to this sub? I can't differentiate it from any of the left-wing ones at this point.***I sincerely hope Trump lives a long and healthy life.

But I also hope he and tbose that admire him learn from this.


 Trump has downplayed the danger of Covid and discouraged people (if only implicitly) from wearing masks. 

I hope he changes his message. It can only make America safer and speed economic recovery.***People downplaying this are idiots. We in the U.K. saw how fast Boris went from ‚Äúfine‚Äù to ‚Äúnot fine‚Äù.***I wish him a transformational experience that does not involve death, where at the end of his experience he champions public safety in regards to covid-19.


Interpret this as you will.******Honestly I just think it's precautionary. He's an older guy. I think he'll be fine. He looked very spry and confident on his walk into Walter Reed.***The smugness on most of reddit right now is so ridiculous. We should all be hoping for a speedy recovery***I'm sure he'll be fine. Considering where he's going, it's one hell of a medical center. He's doing the right thing by going now rather than later. At least they can monitor him minute by minute rather than doing it himself and waiting till it's too late.***Misleading headline, 

*hospitalized as a precaution but still feeling well enough to put on a suit, stand up and speak to the American people.***Rip mods, so many comments to clean up***Pray for the president.***Hopefully he can lose some weight after he recovers. He needs to stay healthy for another four years!***This is misleading. He was only sent there out of precaution. His symptoms are the same they were earlier in the day, mild.***I lean left for sure and am in no way a supporter of Trump but damn if this isn‚Äôt bad news. I really do wish him a speedy recovery. A sick president is not good for America no matter what side you lean towards. 

I know there will be a lot of let‚Äôs say... emotional liberals claiming this as good news but they are beyond wrong in saying that.***There are some very...interesting...awards on this post. Me thinks we have some bad faith lefties around.***This is absolutely awful***If only it was a hoax. I wish him well.***I prefer presidents that don‚Äôt get hospitalized.***Wish him well...but be more energized for the vote turnout!***I am neither a conservative or liberal, and frankly the response from left-leaning friends of mine has been disappointing. I don't personally support Trump, but genuinely hope this is only a precaution and that he has a speedy recovery.***Say what you want about Trump, dislike or like him his own stupidity may have caused this. Albeit said wishing pain on another human makes you as bad as you think he is.

It‚Äôs rough if you get the more harsh side of this virus, the fall out of this is enormous.***Terrible post title.***Anyone wishing harm on the leader of our country is simply unamerican and not worth consideration.  I don't care who is president, I'm wishing them the best because it's the humane thing to do.  There are certain things larger than politics and this is one of them.

Not surprising to see some of the responses on Reddit though.  Reddit is a form of social media and you'll always have the absolute worst that humanity has to offer on full display on any social media site.  They're not worth acknowledging because they don't represent what 95% of the rest of the world represents.  Most people are decent and caring.***Hospitalized may be over egging the pudding, he is in hospital for observation and in case he suddenly takes a turn for the worse, which is possible with his age and obesity.***ü¶Äü¶Ä***This is such a hyped headline***I am not conservative and I don't support Trump at all.  I do hope that a sick person can get well.

That being said, I hope conservatives lobby the fuck out of his govt to release the ""antibiotic cocktail"" that was used to treat him if it proves to be successful.  To me, that would be a moral compass test and gauntlet thrown down by the opposition.***I wish him a speedy and full recovery!***Funny to see everyone caring about covid now :)***I pray for you, sir. 

Please, stay strong and continue to lead this great nation.***May he have a speedy recovfefe***Thoughts and prayers.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=gT-LfVlTE94***So serious question, I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has the answer.

If both Trump and Biden were to die or become otherwise indefinitely unfit, do the VPs become the new nominees or does it go to Bernie and that random republican guy/Kanye that got like 2% in the RNC?

Obviously Pence becomes president until the next term but who is the nominee? I‚Äôd think it‚Äôd have to go by the order from the DNC and RNC or even a revote for democracy sake***Heres a question... One I'm sure someone has answered before. What happens if he does pass before the election? Who takes his place as the nominee? What about early votes?***Thats a bit of a misleading headline...***People are giving awards to this post because they find this hilarious. I'm sure they wish he was dead as well.***I'll pray for Trump, and his recovery. Its sad to see that the left has become so hypocritical and rabid. A month ago they called us all unfeeling monsters who wanted to kill grandma for wanting to re-open the economy, because it could give someone else COVID.

Now they cheer and rejoice at the fact that Trump has gotten COVID. So much for the bountiful fountain of empathy leftist ideology claims to hold. Leftists aren't compassionate, they are emotional. There is a big, **big** difference.

Its sad that not even this can bring left and right together. Until this moment, COVID was the one thing both sides had empathy for. All the social media influencers and politicians were loud in their public displays of empathy towards the victims of COVID. But when Trump gets it, we see a totally different emotional response: one of hatred and contempt.***The trouble I'm having is reconciling all the ""Trump is a fascist dictator!"" takes from the past 3 years with ""Get well, Trump! No one deserves corona"" takes. I know that if I *truly* believed that the president was a fascist dictator, I wouldn't be wishing him to get well. I'd want them to leave in the most immediate manner possible. 

So was all that 'omg fascist dictatorship!' talk something they never believed? (seems likely) 

Or is the sudden respectful tone and well-wishing just an attempt to be *seen* as a 'good person' on social media? (virtue signaling)***I‚Äôve been caring for Covid patients for months now. Looking fine and feeling fine are not clear indicators that he is fine. Quite a few of the patients I‚Äôve cared for do not understand why they can‚Äôt just go home well past the point they are in the icu. The hypoxia that is caused by covid just doesn‚Äôt trigger the same kind of air hunger that other causes of hypoxia do. Hardcore Trump detractor here but no one should wish anyone Ill and no one benefits from him being ill while he‚Äôs our president. I‚Äôm taking every grain of news with a healthy dose of caution cause I‚Äôve seen how these things go for months now.***Remember when Trump mocked Hillary for getting pneumonia 4 years ago to the day?

Having dealt with patients like I'm sure he'd be (note: not a doc, but long history with health care), I'm not terribly surprised.  It's probably the only way they would be able to keep him from over-pushing himself.  Plus, the fact that he *is* the President, they're going to want to keep an extra careful eye on him. 

At least actually *having* the disease rather just the exposure, means his quarantine should only be 10 days, rather than 14.  At least, that the case if CDC guidance is followed.***The only weird thing that makes me think it‚Äôs worse that it is, is the lack of tweets. You‚Äôd think if he was experiencing mild symptoms he would be tweeting constantly while doctors buzzed around him. Anyone have any insight on this?

He's probably so scared right now with both of his parents having covid. Poor kid. I really hate this***It sounds like a smart move, being where treatment is accessible if needed. He may also be anxious as well, it's a new virus and no one really knows how badly their symptoms will get, better safe than sorry imo.***I don‚Äôt like this one bit.  Putting someone in a hospital out of an abundance of caution is not a normal thing we do.  Yes he is the president but given how he has acted and conducted business, I don‚Äôt see him agreeing to this unless there was an issue.

My theory is he got an X-ray and it didn‚Äôt look great.  The antibody cocktail hopefully will prevent the cytokine spike but if not, this might be bad.  Really hoping I‚Äôm wrong.

#1 ‚Äî Trump did not deny this virus exists, nor do many skeptics deny it exists. It exists. 

#2 ‚Äî Trump did not deny this virus is deadly, nor do many skeptics deny it is deadly. It's deadly.

Despite existing and being deadly, the facts remain: we're looking at a mortality rate of <0.3% with the vast majority of deaths being men aged 60 or older, with pre-existing conditions. Obviously Trump may fall into that range, and obviously this virus has posed a risk to his health ever since it first sprung up. His attitude however has been geared toward the whole of the nation, which includes many healthy people under the age of 60... Who are being negatively impacted and deprived of their youth. I'll always appreciate Trump for calling for a return to normalcy for my demographic; Biden would have us all in our basements.

ps, I ended up voting for Reagan in 84.  I wasn't a conservative at the the time, but also remember thinking that policy and laws I don't like don't mean squat if the world is unstable and the US is at risk from the Soviets, and I saw him as the best candidate to ensure that stability.

She ended up collapsing and immediately dying after she called 911 and the paramedics were walking into her home. She didn‚Äôt have covid, was nowhere on her death certificate. She had a massive blood clot that traveled to her lungs. But she was so scared for weeks that she refused medical help until it was literally two minutes before she died. It‚Äôs very sad.

Mouth infections are nothing to mess around with, yet I was told they literally could not see me and if the pain was unbearable to go to the ER. 

Now I‚Äôm having further issues because I have severe PTSD and asthma on top of that, so wearing a mask is very difficult for me. I went to see a pulmonologist last month to address some breathing difficulties I‚Äôve had recently, and wore my chiffon mask that I have that allows for easy breathing and is light enough that I can wear it for a few minutes without it setting off a panic attack.

1. Was this theft offense substantially motivated by the state of emergency, or simply a theft offense which occurred contemporaneous to the declared state of emergency?

a. Factors to consider in making this determination:

i. Was the target business open or closed to the public during the state of emergency?
ii. What was the manner and means by which the suspect gained entry to the business?
iii. What was the nature/quantity/value of the goods targeted?
iv. Was the theft committed for financial gain or personal need?
v. Is there an articulable reason why another statute wouldn‚Äôt adequately address the particular incident?

iv. Is the part that has people all upset but it sounds like they‚Äôre trying to differentiate between looting and robbery. And if someone stole 10 cases of water because they wanted to resell the for 40 bucks a case in a state of emergency, and if someone stole 10 cases of water because a wildfire cut them off from any clean water and they needed it to live then I would expect it to be prosecuted differently***How far does this ""needs"" thing go?

The idea being that someone who stole as much of the most expensive things they could carry committed a greater offense than someone who stole a jacket and shoes that fits them.

This is the DA properly interpreting the law. If you disagree, your issue should be with the CA legislature. 

IMHO, the biggest issue here is the light punishment if their actions fall under petty theft. It‚Äôs entirely possible that the only punishment is a fine less than the value of what they stole.

Because they probably had a meeting about it and realized that they won't be able to get away with this one. So they decided to make an announcement and apply the policy minimally to the most visible users then tell the media to say there's no bias at Twitter. Then they'll pat themselves on the back and only remove tweets if enough people report it.***There goes half their users***Good! No matter your political views, no one should wish for his or anyone else's death. So messed up.***Is this called Platitude Virtue Signalling?

Think about it -- neutral people probably can't recall seeing anything bad being said about RBG when she passed.  Because from what I read here Twitter was pre censoring already identified conservatives before they could even post (by making them have to verify that they were not bots or something like that).  

But Twitter is allowing all the left to tap dance over Trump's ""surely impending death"", this isn't a good look for them, and has the potential to sway undecided voters to Trump's side.

That is the only reason I can think of that Twitter would suddenly ""show a concern"" for POTUS' well-being.***Wait.... is Twitter shutting down then?***If someone's political beliefs are so toxic that they hope for someone else to die, that's on them.

Good job twitter!***i'll believe it when i see it. people have been spewing death wishes for trump for 4 years and twitter did nothing about it. it's going to be just like how /r/politics gets run where the decisions makers conveniently ""won't see"" offending posts, or will make up some bullshit excuse as to why it's not a death wish.***Too little, too late.

What on EARTH happened?******How is this surprising, they have been receiving marxist indoctrination from these insane academics***It's only surprising if you haven't been paying attention***I went to Berkeley, and this was incredibly evident. One day, there were suddenly dozens of cops in full riot gear with military grade vehicles patrolling campus. Several buildings were cordoned off, and travel/backpacks were restricted. What was the occasion that called for such precautions? A conservative Jewish man wanted to answer questions on campus. In appropriate response to this ‚Äúaffront to the safety of PoC,‚Äù Antifa came out to riot. As a PoC, I definitely feel safer when people in masks who don‚Äôt go here come to smash and burn shit. On one occasion, students in one of my classes yelled at the virulently Anti-Trump/left-wing professor and called him a white supremacist for not cancelling the midterm scheduled that day (video was posted to this sub of it).

I firmly believe that free exchange promotes good ideas. I talked to several people of all backgrounds at that Shapiro talk. Most, like myself, were not College Republicans. They just wanted to hear what he had to say, and were bewildered by the outrage and insults they had to endure from the mob while walking through the security checkpoint. 

Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt even protest an actual Nazi coming to campus. I would attend his event and point out the myriad of flaws in various white supremacist conspiracy theories and watch him flounder about like a moron trying to straw man his way out of defending idiotic talking points. And while everyone watches how tortuous his ‚Äúlogic‚Äù becomes, hopefully people who were leaning toward radicalization will realize that racism is not conducive to a functioning and just society. With free speech and organized, civil discussions, I am optimistic that the best ideas can triumph.***As someone who is surrounded by this crowd a lot, it is not surprising.

Our TAX FUNDED universities in the UK also regularly censor speakers and have even expelled and sacked students and staff for voicing more conservative opinions. 

Here in the UK, most universities have officially endorsed and supported BLM. Whilst I can understand this of private universities as they can do whatever the like and suffer the financial consequences of their actions, most universities in the UK are public institutions payed for by the tax payer. 

Public universities should officially remain neutral by neither endorsing or condemning groups. They wouldn‚Äôt do this with religion. If a university claimed that Hinduism was right and gave it full support they are, by default, claiming that other religions such as Christianity and Islam are wrong. This is what they are doing by supporting groups like BLM.

Universities are claiming they know what is ‚Äúright‚Äù and they know better than everyone else when they support one set of views and condemn another.***Young, dumb, and full of cum***LOL autocorrect. It substituted ""surprising"" for ""easily predictable.""

It affects my company, which is a smaller privately owned company, about $80k a year more in taxes now. 

Washington state basically tried to push on their financial shortfalls to companies like Boeing so Boeing is now removing themselves from that equation. Stupid. They also employ 35,000 people in their Everett operations. 

Biden wants to raise the corporate tax though and is still too stupid to see that it will just push jobs overseas. Same reason tech companies hold their IP in Switzerland; they shift revenue and tax liability there through transfer pricing. I used to work for a software company and we would do this due to creating a tax agreement with them to only pay 4% tax. The liberals wanting to tax companies a lot actually bets the government less taxes.***Lol.

It's tough for the people that work there but what are they supposed to do because they are a business, not an a charity to be exploited.

Well, they have a right to go somewhere else where the business environment is more favorable. I dont know why leftists think they can assert control over companies who dont want to follow their ideology. They have a right to leave.***Lol, sucks to suck. Decades of bad policy coming home to roost.***It‚Äôs a beautiful thing.***While the unions haven‚Äôt been much help, it‚Äôs a bit misleading to put the brunt of blame on the state.

Washington state gave them an $8.6 billion tax break. Last year Boeing made $76 billion in revenue and saw their stock hit an all-time-high. Since then, they‚Äôve tanked. Their production lines are shut down, orders are being cancelled, and they still haven‚Äôt provided a fix. 

Boeing is trash, seeing as their planes can‚Äôt even stay in the air. They‚Äôre a failing business that can‚Äôt compete with newer avionic companies like Blue Origin and SpaceX (both of which have recently built manufacturing sites in Seattle and continue to win government funded contracts). For a company that has a monopoly on commercial air travel, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be doing ok.

Sad to see the leadership at the company deteriorate. Boeing used to hire within. They would bring manufacturers and engineers up to management roles. Now all they do is throw in managers who don‚Äôt know shit about aerospace, push a few papers, then fly off with a nice bonus. 

There facility in NC is wrought with quality issues and I suspect SC to be the same. As a Washingtonian it‚Äôs sad to see, but good riddance.***You love to see it.***Washingtonian with Boeing ties here - the comments are speculative nonsense. Some have some truth but so much garbage I had to comment. 

Some comments about unions. The unions in Washington State get too powerful and then nothing can be done.  This is true.  Look at the Seattle Police department.  They give new hires 90k salaries plus hefty signing bonuses, but have little retention of those new hires.  They can‚Äôt fire senior desk workers, no matter what, who make upwards of 200k per year. Don‚Äôt forget pensions and shit. 

Boeing is no different. They continually have to offer retirement packages to get people to quit near the ends of their careers. Then, once they‚Äôre no longer earning their union benefits, they get brought in as private consultants once retired at an extreme hourly rate. It‚Äôs been cyclical. They bleed money, wonder why, then try to find ways to get around the money. 

The SC move has been a long time coming and no one is surprised. I was told by an ex-employee that the SC move was impending years ago, and they were just waiting for an excuse. 

It has little to do with the political climate of the state. Boeing stopped being a plane company and started being a financial company that makes planes when they merged with McDonnell Douglas, and since then it‚Äôs been more about money than anything else. The taxes in this state are not as unfavorable as other components of the business. 

They have to pay people more money here than they would in SC, in general. Cost of living is massive in and around the Seattle suburbs. Median home price is less than half what it is in Seattle***Here's the actual cited source that isn't cancer:

I would be heartbroken if Mercedes would move out of southern Germany even if their state is now ruled by the environmentalists and social democrats...

They don't even hide that. They straight up call it ""unconscious bias training."" They make it pretty clear they want to control your thoughts.***This is anti-China shill article. Honestly, not sure why it's trying to tie in China to BLM / CRT when these two things have enough that can be critiqued separately. 

Secondly, for those who have read history, in particular early Soviet history there is something eerily familiar with the left movement today.

You see in the early 1920's when the bolsheviks emerged victorious, they found themselves in a society that they believed was filled with their enemies. The enemies were mensheviks, the white russians, the capitalists, the internationalists etc. But they occupied various positions, and frequently of power, in the USSR.  

As the 1920's got underway and things didn't pan out into a communist utopia as they'd hoped, they started increasingly coming to believe that it was the people in their midst that were the ultimate problem. That internal saboteurs were intentionally crippling the move in the right direction.

And so, slowly at first, but with increasingly speed and ferocity, society and soviet leadership began 'rooting out' the supposed evil every where they could find it. 

At first it was quite clear who the 'bad' people were. They wrote critical articles, or served in the wrong armies during the civil war. So they were shot. But by the late 20's, when the low hanging fruit were killed off, they struggled to find the 'enemies of the revolution'. Things were still not good in the USSR. But if all the 'bad people' were killed, how come things weren't good? Easy. There were still enemies everywhere. Except now they were even more treacherous because they were actually very similar to you in most ways. They were 'soft communists' - even worse than capitalists, because they were snakes.  

Suddenly the scope of activities which could land you in trouble became incredibly vague. An air of secrecy reigned in society, so you could never know who talked to who. There was immense pressure in all aspects of daily life to 'serve the revolution'. So you'd go to work and swear off the capitalist pigs, and then go off to some administrative task and praise the leader. The thing is, you never knew whether it was enough. You were never comfortable saying your thoughts out loud because it wasn't clear who you could trust. Saying the wrong thing during a lunch time conversation could suddenly lead to a demotion from work, or a transfer to the East - thus destroying your livelihood. Saying something downright anti-communist or sarcastic was enough to earn a visit from the Cheka (later the NKVD). Because you didn't know where the line was, you started behaving in wildly pro-communist ways in public, despite knowing that it was a silly thing to do. The best way to be pro-communist, was to accuse others of not being communist enough. This societal 'shaming' had the intended consequences. People, fearing for the lives starting getting in line. They expunged bad thoughts from their heads, sold out their friends and family, and will fully served the revolution.***The whole point of sensitivity training and a focus on how White america has an unequally large amount of power in this country is not to say this country is  unredeemably (not a word, js) evil but actually the opposite; to point out ways in which this country can fully live up the the self-evident truths that all men are created equal and liberty and justice for all. All these trainings aim for is some reflection on ourselves and our society, and an acknowledgement that it‚Äôs indeed possible for Black people or other people of color to be treated unfairly due to the way they look and the thoughts that provokes in White people‚Äôs minds. 

Maybe something to understand here is that often times the goal is not to blame individual White people. Yes people can be racist and that‚Äôs a problem, but the main problem is that we have been ‚Äòtrained‚Äô through ideas passed down through generations from when White people were still all in Europe, to have these automatic negative thoughts about POCs, and that needs to be addressed since we are in such a diverse country that is likely not going to change soon. 

These programs do not evoke hostilities, but they address hostilities that exist and that have real implications. The only ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù trying to be induced here is to take an objective look at how White people may have benefited from the systems in this country and how those same systems may not give POCs that same advantages. 

If you are unable to honestly say ‚ÄòThe United States is not perfect‚Äô then I personally just find that sad. Nothing is perfect, no country is perfect. Of course we have room to improve, especially in a world that is always changing.

The author deliberately stops here.  That's probably because, if he were to go on to explain how this could occur, it would derail his entire article.

There are a few ways to move a motion from committee to the floor under Senate rules:

* Unanimous consent: it is what it sounds like and obviously won't happen.

* Motion to proceed: while this only requires a simple majority, it is susceptible to extended debate.  If the Democrats wanted, they could filibuster this.  As it would take 60 votes for cloture in this case, the idea is DOA.

* Committee votes to move it out of committee...not gonna happen.

A still uncivilized creature, known to inhabit mostly geographic parts of the US where its livelihood is almost based exclusively on deviant behavior towards more Conservative groups.

In this rare image, you can see many features previously unknown to this subspecies. Two eyes limbs, and legs, almost appearing human-like.

Previous lore has been unable to be specific on the physical features, but fortunately, images like the above have made C. Democratica more identifiable.

Mostly coming out at night, this Chupacabra Democratica can be seen being fascinated by a simple Trump sign (on very rare occasions, families of C. Democratica can be observed defecating on and ritualizing Trump signage).

Trump signs are now well-documentated fixations for these creatures of the night.

As a precaution, do not antagonize these creatures directly unless experienced and proper equipment is used (high velocity mechanisms seem to work most efficiently), and due to many unknown diseases which this subspecies is known to have (e.g., TDS), thick gloves should be worn if contact is expected.

Generally speaking, it is best to let C. Democratica conduct their normal activity at night, but if necessary, a spotlight in their direction is known to confuse. 

A call to your local Vector Control agency should prevent chronic visitations, however many Conservatives and families enjoy these rather unintelligent creatures, and even despite having a mysteriously large cranial size, the Chupacabra Democratica can provide several months of entertainment.***Are they even wearing pants?***Are they even wearing pants?

j4oigh,"***Critical Race Theory. Don't let people like Chris Wallace try to tell you what it is.***This is one of the biggest corruptions from the left. Black and white are left social constructs that promote oppression and victim mentality to be divisive in an attempt to gain from the division. The reality is that within what is wrongly referred to black and white, there are many ethnicities. Even in Caucasian and African heritages, for example, there can be Scottish, Irish, English, Welsh, Cornish, German, Dutch, Flemish, French etc. and even more ethnicities beyond those titles. African-American can extend to Bantu, Mossi, Kwele, Maasai, Matumbi, Khoisan etc.  


The critical race theory is so flawed that the ONLY defence leftists can come up with if challenged is what if black or white needs to be described in a crime incident description, when it's just a matter of describing northern European, African, east Asian, Pacific Islander appearances etc. that are matter of fact and are not loaded anti-intellectual divisive political terms like black or white.***The time for this was during its inception***Douglas Murray: It is time we fight  racism.

Twitter has been a shit show. People need to understand that the virus isn‚Äôt like it was in March, The virus has mutated, weakened. And even people who are older and overweight, the odds of it being life threatening are still extremely low and trump doesn‚Äôt have any underlying health conditions, he‚Äôs just overweight, and no he‚Äôs not ‚Äú morbidly obese ‚Äú  and again he‚Äôs getting the absolute best treatment and we know know a lot more about the virus and what to do about it than we did earlier than this year.

2) because of #1, most Democrats will not verify if said liberal proposals are truth. (Or another way of looking at it is they won‚Äôt find news from other sources that disagree with what they believe)

This officer explains in the beginning about how history repeats itself and here he is watching it unfold again. So, these groups may have new names but the ideas and strategies they‚Äôre playing out are old ideas, they may grasp power for short term but I feel these groups will be driven out eventually. Or at least I‚Äôd like to hope for, I worry for officers of any color, race or creed because most of them are good people, men and women, gay or straight, they are fighting an upward battle now to maintain their reputation, to understand that they need to increase their efforts in maintaining peace and respect amongst the community. 

I also believe communication between police departments and the community needs to be re-examined, I think their needs to be more public speaking and Q&A‚Äôs between the two, I think the police and each individual community deserves to create a new atmosphere between them and help boil down to the issues and sort of resolve we want in our cities. Yes, we agree with democrats that the police do have racists and bad people in them, no doubt, however with that said, just because a small amount of police commit crimes themselves does not mean the entire police force is built of crimes and racism. The need for more cops to speak up and create more dialogue the better. And they too deserve to go home to their families, god bless them***The final bit sums up the situation pretty well.

Shame on the politicians, teachers and parents justifying it and adding fuel to the fire.

Our society coddled this mentality, behavior and shielded it from responsibility for a generation. The chickens are coming home to roost now and we're seeing it nightly.

These groups or movements or theories fundamentally HAD to redefine racism to mean ""systemic racism"" (meaning any socioeconomic disparity between racial groups being indicative of a broader, invisible, unidentifiable racist agenda that has to be corrected by any means necessary). There's just not enough real instances of racism to get upset about (thus race hoaxes) and those instances are too anecdotal and have a clear cut culprit. They need an amorphous conspiratorial agenda. Secondly, one of the major tools in their arsenal is actual racism to fight ""systemic racism""

Again It‚Äôs absolutely not right it‚Äôs just my opinion of why this is happening in places like Seattle and Portland that don‚Äôt have many black people. It‚Äôs just my theory kind of how middle America‚Äôs finger to the establishment was Trump for sending all of their jobs overseas. With that being said voting is acceptable but looting is not.

Hes very measured. And he understands the issues and he seems to understand that the issues arent always what people are freaking out over. You could tell there was passion in him but that didnt dictate his ability to communicate.

Qlso, from a more shallow look, hes a black police officer. He has a bit more insight on these topics than most do.

Dominant caste (white) people feeling a sense of unearned and paternalistic familiarity with black people.

""I know what's good for you better than you know what's good for yourself.""

It's not about left or right with regards to what the officer is discussing, it's about how people in the dominant caste feel they can take liberties with people from the lower castes.

You'll see the same thing in Indian society where dominant caste individuals will feel justified speaking on behalf of Dalits, because they've been taught by society that it's their place to offer their opinion even when it doesn't concern them.

These are both affiliates of the CCP and Reschenthaler‚Äôs proposed ending of exemptions makes it that nearly no one in China is eligible to immigrate which is ridiculous policy IMO.

Wanna know why? The exact same reasons the Trump tax story is misleading and missing context, I.e. an unverifiable source, and corporate income taxes being far more complex.

You really can‚Äôt make this stuff up.***I love how even with this information released, they still plug pleas for donations as commercials on their ‚ÄúThe Daily‚Äù podcast. The hypocrisy is actually just sickening at this point***I wish New York Times was still the amazing publication they used to be. Oh wait, they were always fake news.

NYT literally covered up the Stalin Famines and pushed propaganda that the famine was a right wing conspiracy theory, while millions were dying from starvation.

NYT fake news led to a report about WMDs in the middle east that is credited with turning public opinion, and serving as a catalyst for the war declaration. Fake news helped lead us to a war based on imaginary threats.

NYT Trump-Russia collusion was debunked as false. NYT Russian Bounties story was debunked. 

They have been fake news going all the way back to the '40s. It's amazing that they still have readers. They truly are public enemy number one.***Who the fuck pays for the New York Times??***That's truly awful. We should, like, change tax laws or something so that no one can do that anymore.***Guys the tax code in America is straight up broken.

I'm still pissed at Trump, but now I'm also furious with NYT.***New York Times is my least favorite brand of toilet paper. 

It's scratchy and takes itself far too seriously.***hey! That's a classic one!***I wish to learn these powers!***Adding this to all the others is evidence that we need serious Tax reform in this country.  We need to end this swiss cheese income tax system and replace it with a value added tax, which would tax how much you spend and not how hard you work.  

Its absolutely rediculous.  I have to pay a service every year just to explain to me how much I owe.  And if I don't pay the right person enough money, then I get ripped off by the government.  Its insane.***is it a stock company?

I'm amazed they still have ANY profits  - well there is always the Soros money ....***Based***Lmao.***What is ""earnings"" ? Is that profit? Or is that EBITDA? Because unless its a post-expense number, they wouldn't owe taxes on it. Businesses are allowed to use interest, depreciation, amortization expense to offset revenues. So this announcement is pointless without a better definition of ""earnings.""

Can we please do better here?***And if they didn‚Äôt break the law, I don‚Äôt care.***I mean does anyone read the NYT‚Äôs anymore?  I imagine they were offsetting previous losses.***I‚Äôm curious: are those tax returns fake, or were they illegally obtained?***Everyone here sees this as a problem right? Because I do. I see large corporations and rich people paying almost nothing in taxes. It doesn't matter if its Donald Trump, or the NYT, or Jeff Bezos. Rich people have consistently ripped the American people off. Do you see now why there should be tax reform? Do you see now why we should increase the corporate tax? If you think that the NYT paying nothing in taxes is bad, you agree with me. They are doing the same things that everyother corporation and rich person is doing, and fucking over the rest of America. But its not their fault, it's the system that we live in, and its the reason we need to change it, so that all these rich people and corporations start giving their fair share back to the American people.***Left,right it doesn't matter the truth is rich vs everyone else***The left wants you to think that paying more taxes, such as bernies plan, would help the poor people. That's the biggest load of garbage and people eat it up. The monies collected every tax season isn't even enough to pay the interest on our debt owed to the federal reserve. A billionaire paying a 60-70% tax rate would not help any poor person in the least. They wouldn't see a penny of that money anyways. It's virtue signaling plain and simple.***The people are becoming required to be self sustaining as well as corporations the government is technically a corporation but is not required to become self sustaining but only spends money like it grows on trees. Our government should start-running like a corporation using its created resources and military to siphon money from the world instead of its people after all America is the most powerful country in the world so requiring its people to prop it up with hard work makes absolutely no sense at all.***They are not the only corporation that has paid $0 in taxes. If you truly care about this issue across the board you would not just point out entities you dislike. Also Trump‚Äôs taxes that are in question are his personal income taxes not his corporate taxes.***The NY times is a shameless rag.***This is a fantastic what-about-ism. Two things can be bad at the same time. NY Times should absolutely have to pay their appropriate taxes, just like Apple and Amazon which also pay hilariously low or 0 taxes. The president also should have paid appropriate taxes. Both things are true, neither takes away from the other.***Yes. They are in the wrong too. Doesn‚Äôt excuse Trump. Doesn‚Äôt excuse any of these billionaires. They all use the same bullshit loophole to pay 0 taxes. So we gotta fix it***Only the finest tax lawyers in the land can come up with numbers like that.  Highly, HIGHLY paid tax lawyers, employed by the wealthy so they can dodge whatever nickle they can.  Much like registering their yachts in a different state, saves em thousands of dollars a year in many cases but just business as usual in their circles.***News flash!  Corporations do not pay taxes.  

They look for loopholes in the tax code, even to the point of hiring lobbyists and outright bribing public officials to create loopholes in the tax laws, to avoid paying or to lessen their tax burden.  

They use every write off imaginable.  

If they owe taxes at the end of the year, they simply raise the cost of their product and pass on that tax bill to the consumers.

While that is free enterprise, I do wish there was a better and more fair way to fund the government.***BuT tHE NEw YOrk tImes IsNT thE PreSidENT!!!***Sweet I‚Äôm glad Conservatives agree that Businesses and rich individuals should pay their fair share of taxes.

Info from annual reports should be publicly available to do this.

Find annually total revenue, taxes paid, and what amount of tax they SHOULD have paid based on the corporate tax rate for that year.

Yes, expenses will reduce taxable income.  But that can be shown too and an adjustment can be made in the ""should have paid this amount of taxes"" calc.

I'd like to know an est of taxes the govt is NOT receiving based on this type of thing. 

If anyone knows a published study like this, please post a link?  Thanks in advance. 

This is no different than Hollywood movies selling $100 million+ in ticket sales but claiming because of expenses their net was ZERO so they pay no taxes either.  For a long time, Hollywood accounting needs to be thrown out and replaced. 

I'm not a big govt guy in the least.  But if corps are not paying millions and billions in taxes, something is seriously wrong and individuals and smaller business are then leaned on for more tax. 

When it comes to personal taxes, I'm all for a flat tax %.  When it comes to corps, I'm coming around to the idea that after a certain level of gross income, a graduated higher tax should be implemented along with graduates caps on expenses that reduce taxable income. 

And before anyone goes off prematurely, my wife and I have owned an S Corp on the side for over 25 years.  So this does affect me.

We should not be taxing corporations in the first place. Trying to ‚Äúhide‚Äù the tax burden this way is counterproductive.

Background

In 2008 there was a huge international controversy when an old 1992 video clip from Paul de Leeuw's own TV show was posted on Youtube. This video has since then been meticulously removed from Youtube and other major platforms ‚Äì even from Bitchute. But, there is still one platform where the 4,5 min. clip still remains: https://d.tube/#!/v/transformati22/QmdU1ukJ5rq4BghtQ8Kkiqz4VugTabCvXgMokC12Aa5PnL. If you are for some reason not outraged enough at the beginning of the video then watch the last 20 seconds‚Ä¶!

The Infamous Brongersma.info website

What I find very revealing is that Paul de Leeuw is referred to several times in the posts of the pedophilia promoting website brongersma.info. There is for example the following entry: ‚ÄúWhat does Paul de Leeuw think of when someone says 'Martijn'? Tonight in the broadcast of PaPaul the answer turned out: ""a chief editor of a pedophile magazine"". This off-topic comment was a bit dead, but is actually more of an insider joke;) ‚Äú This ‚Äúinside joke‚Äù refers to the infamous court-banned Dutch pedophilia association Vereniging Martijn.

Direct accusations

The following excerpt is translated from a Dutch web article: https://www.boublog.nl/2017/09/10/seksueel-geweld-en-bart-van-well/ and it also refers to this article: https://web.archive.org/web/20111130004924/http://www.klokkenluideronline.nl/artikel/796/ook-ed-van-thijn-in-beeld-bij-pedo-netwerk.html

‚Äú Below is a transcript of notes taken by Micha Kat from an interview held on Sunday January 16, 2011 in Hellevoetsluis. The identity of the source is known to this site and can be revealed to the National Prosecutor's Office if the Public Prosecution Service undertakes to respect the source in its rights. The importance of the source is also apparent from the fact that he has proven to be the source of an explosive article published on December 7, 2004 on Kleintje Muurkrant about a pedo-bar in Amsterdamse Paardenstraat (the 'Festival Bar') where people like Ed van Thijn, Paul de Leeuw and Andre van Duin raped children. This bar was closed shortly after the publication of the said document. ‚Äú

Modified Wikipedia profile

The following cannot be taken as direct evidence against Paul de Leeuw in this matter but curiously in December 2017 an article appeared in the political weblog Dagelijkse Standaard https://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2017/12/dienst-parkeerbeheer-amsterdam-neemt-paul-de-leeuw-op-de-korrel-hij-staat-bekend-als-pedofiel/. It states that someone from the city of Amsterdam‚Äôs parking service department had modified Paul de Leeuw‚Äôs Wikipedia page claiming that he is living a double life and is actually a pedophile. This claim has since been removed by other Wikipedia moderators.

Association with the Dutch ""Harvey Weinstein""

Paul de Leeuw also happens to be a good friend of Job Gosschalk who resigned his position as a producer and director of a known Dutch film company due to sexual misconduct. Mr. Gosschalk has been called the Dutch Harvey Weinstein and there has also been accusations that he has abused children (underage). See RTL channel presenter‚Äôs research on this subject (in Dutch): https://www.nporadio1.nl/75-jaar-vrijheid/onderwerpen/7626-2017-11-15-wendy-beenakker-job-gosschalk-heeft-zeker-3-minderjarigen-misbruikt.

In spite of a huge public controversy and disgust towards Mr. Gosschalk Paul de Leeuw has openly requested that Gosschalk should be forgiven and returned back to his former position as a caster for movie roles!

Pedophile symbol on his music album cover

There is a boy-lover's symbol on his musical album cover. https://twitter.com/Transformati1/status/1278403731072126979/photo/1

The name of the album is ""For your majesty"". Hmm, this put s chills down my spine when you consider the alleged involvement of the former Dutch Queen Beatrix in child sacrifice rituals. See the testimonial of a brave Dutch woman Annemarie van Blijenburg here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=LWEw4nfhMVM&feature=emb_logo 

Revealing song lyrics

The lyrics of one of Paul de Leeuw's songs goes like this (translated with Google translate from: https://genius.com/Paul-de-leeuw-de-hit-lyrics)

He had a children's choir with voices as gems...Lalalalala...I sang songs with 40 golden throats...Lalalalala It was great to do, I kissed them all

Children crowded into my yard, get lost...Lalalalala... When they saw me they started to sing, Wodan took it...Lalalalala...I became nervous, I became unstable, I became LESS AND LESS PEDOPHILE.

The truly bizarre Filmpje! movie from 1995

Paul de Leeuw also wrote the script and acted the main roles in a disturbing 1995 movie called Filmpje! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMwOYbu3o-k&fbclid=IwAR0pu-gY9u4ZjCdTESrh0e3ZCsMv27HP3oRBWE46lSyT4w_7-DQ7NL5iinE? Already during the first minute they start talking about ordering a child ('rare kindje') from the internet. Although it is meant to refer to an adoption this really gives me a bad feeling...

At a strange scene (starts 6:05) Papa spits into the crib, shakes it violently and then throws the whole crib against a wall. It is unclear if a baby was inside (I hope not).

At the court room scene (starts 8:25) there is a naked baby doll on the table..

In one scene (starts 19:27) the main character 'Papa' visits a strange ""Eyes wide shut"" type of corporate building where sex services are offered.

In another scene (starts 27:49) the 'Papa' comes home and his daughter (who is wearing a really gruesome looking tooth straightening device on her head) goes to greet him by kneeling in front of him ‚Äì what happens after this is not shown. After this 'Papa' violently throws his daughter against the glass door of a cabinet. A bit strange...

And sure enough a Wizard of Oz inspired clip (start 1:34:16) is used in this movie. According to victims of sexual abuse, ""pedophiles abuse the movie The Wizard of Oz to brainwash their child sex slaves.""

For some reason there are lobsters everywhere in the movie - the main character (Paul) is even wearing a lobster in his/her head dress. According to the Urban dictionary website the term ‚Äòrock lobster‚Äô refers to a male pedofile.

The movie is supposed to be funny but it has a very dark undertone the whole time... My Dutch isn't good enough but I am pretty sure there are more indications of pedophilia in this movie.

Adoption

Considering this background I think it is a bit alarming that Paul de Leeuw adopted two children from Africa. At the beginning of the disturbing movie Filmpje! they talk about ordering kids from Africa...

Public reactions in the Netherlands

Many Dutch people have expressed their disapproval of the 1992 TV show video but I have also seen disturbingly many people trying to explain it away by using the following types of arguments:

‚ÄúIt was such a long time ago (28 years ago) and the times were different back then.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was a staged act agreed to by the boy‚Äôs parents and and the boy knew what was happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh Paul is Paul ‚Äì he is a comedian and he pushes people‚Äôs buttons, his acts shouldn‚Äôt be taken literally.‚Äù

‚ÄúForeigners just don‚Äôt understand the unique Dutch humour and culture.‚Äù

‚ÄúPaul is is a very famous person, he is also a very likable guy and he shouldn‚Äôt be accused of these kinds of things.‚Äù

Conclusion

BUT, there is still a huge elephant in the living room here - a video that shows a young boy being sexually molested on public TV in a very obvious and graphic manner (whether the act was staged or not). Taking into consideration the other indications I have described above I am asking the same question that was asked by someone on Quora years ago - why is he still allowed to have his own show on Dutch TV? Is he perhaps protected by some very high level people? Does the Dutch society still stick its head in the sand and pretend that there is nothing to address here?!

Biden up by 14, Biden up by 3, Trump up by 3.  Or swing states like PA Trump up by 1, michigan has James up by 2(which means Trump would be as well).

I still follow the polls. But I won't ever trust them again.



I can tell you what I see with my own two eyes.  The support for Trump in michigan is something I've NEVER seen before.  It wasn't like this in 2016 nor was it for Romney, McCain, Bush and Bush.***FiveThirtyEight takes into account multiple polls puts his chances at 18% currently (by comparison, in 2016 they predicted his chances at 29%, which was higher than almost any other prediction).

This election is impossible to predict with COVID and the increase in voting by mail.

 The democrat turn out will be insane this time with mail in voting. Plus I'm sure they have learned from their mistake in 2026.

If anything, those hurt him.

It‚Äôs really shown his strength.***I noticed this year (as opposed to 2016) there are very few Trump signs out, yet in public online forums, more people are saying ""*can't vote for Biden*"".

They're going to vote for somebody.

The signs were a giveaway in 2016 that Trump would win.  I think social media is now that same giveaway.

I think Trump wins by a super majority.***Where is the link to the poll? I‚Äôm on mobile and that site is cancer so maybe I missed it?***Another interesting tidbit is Republicans are out pacing Democrats in new voter registration, a group who will not be counted on likely voter polling or any polling for that matter.***There's never been a point where I thought Biden could honestly beat Trump. It's if Trump can beat all the election meddling. That's who he's really running against this time.***The polls have been trending his way for a while, tbh.

But he's ahead by an ever-decreasing number, and the polls have a lot that seems iffy about them.

At this point, the only thing that needs to be 'off' about the polls for 
Trump to win, is that their forecasted Obama-levels of black turnout fails to materialize. And it will almost certainly fail to materialize judging by enthusiasm and the fact that no other Democrat has achieved it.***C'mon man! lol!***We've seen this time and again let's stop putting faith in any poll at all.

Taxes will go up because they‚Äôll  also start to include employer matches as income. Meaning those of us on the border between income brackets gonna be fucked.***Hey man it's only fair that the government gets it's cut out of your hard earned retirement. Remember that there are people out there that are "" unwilling"" to work and need the welfare to survive.***I don't understand the arguments the cnbc (this was linked to in the original article) is trying to make:

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/22/biden-calls-for-401k-tax-break-overhaul-what-it-means-for-you.html

>For instance, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre making $100,000, and you‚Äôre single, which means you‚Äôre in the 24% tax bracket. If you commit to putting away $10,000 a year ‚Äì 10% of your pay -- into your 401(k), you‚Äôre reaping about $2,400 in tax savings.

>In comparison, a single filer making $40,000 and saving 10% of his pay -- $4,000 ‚Äì into a 401(k) would only reap about $480 in tax savings. That‚Äôs because he‚Äôs in the 12% tax bracket.

>To equally incentivize savers regardless of what they earn, Biden proposes a credit of approximately 26% to replace the deduction savers get for putting money in a 401(k) plan, according to the Tax Policy Center‚Äôs analysis.

No shit that the person who makes more, pays a higher tax rate and makes a larger contribution, is going lower their taxable income by a higher amount if the money is contributed to a traditional 401k

People already have an incentive to save for retirement, regardless of their income level. It's called ""not being fucking broke"" in retirement (and ""employer matching"").***Liberals don‚Äôt understand economics, most importantly, behavioral economics. They believe that when they make changes, people will act the same as they did before the change. They don‚Äôt understand that people are smart enough to change their behavior when rules change. This is why liberals economic policies have failed for decades and also the reason they don‚Äôt understand why conservative economic policies are successful.***I split my retirement into a Roth and regular 401k. Up until recently I didn't have the Roth option, so it all went regular. I'll pay taxes when I withdraw. With my Roth option I'm paying taxes now so I'll avoid taxes later. This benefits me if I expect to be in a higher tax bracket. 

I think realistically the Dems will raise taxes on damn near everybody before I retire so it's an easy choice to make. But it's a choice. This tax plan of Biden's punishes the middle class now to help the poor class. Why not just make it optional? Help the lower tax brackets without screwing the higher tax brackets***Let's punish those who do the right thing and save while cutting back and not spending it on lavish things.

For savers, Biden‚Äôs plan is almost always better, unless you are ultra-wealthy. The only people who lose are people who will have a 26% difference in their tax rate between now and retirement. Most Americans will not. 

The downside is that some smaller employers may choose to stop offering 401k plans altogether; because right now the law is that if you want it for yourself you need to offer it to everyone. If it‚Äôs less beneficial for owners they may not want it for themselves and thus may not offer it to employees. 

However, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that being the case (and this article doesn‚Äôt have any data backing it up, just saying that it might happen). 401ks are seen as a benefit, so most companies want to offer one (even if they don‚Äôt match).

Onset of symptoms was extremely rapid. I was fine the night before, felt 100% normal, and woke up withe the sore throat and fever, and by lunch time that day I had a slight cough, and by nightfall I chest hurt because the cough was so rough.

I slept on it, some discomfort the next day. Fever went away, still had a cough.

Slept on it again and woke up feeling 95% recovered. I had a slight cough that carried for about 3 weeks after. You know, that lingering cough that just won't go away, but you drink some water and it goes away, cough drop it goes away, but nothing and every 10 or 15 minutes a slight cough to clear to clear it. That was it.

We didn't even know we had Covid-19, actually, as we never got tested for it. It just seemed like such a minor thing to us. We only found out later because my wife works as a Dental Hygienist and so the Dentist, her boss, got antibody tested and came back positive, so he had all of his staff get tested and my wife had antibodies as well. So, we got tested as a family, also all came back positive on antibodies. Did my test at CVS and literally had the results within 24hrs.

The economy is worse that 4 years so  800,000 new unemployment claims just last week. Hate crimes have been rising in the last 4 years.  So yeah gays are way less safe . We still have death panels , what do you think those people at your insurance company are who deny your claims,  won't give you permission for your procedures.   But conservatives ablity to ignore reality is strong.***What‚Äôs funny about this is that no matter how ludicrous the claim, when it doesn‚Äôt come true they always say it‚Äôs because of how hard they fought against it and pat themselves on the back.***Posting this unironically makes me very concerned about our future.***Can anyone look at this clown's comment/post history and make a valid argument they're not a bot?***The economy is not in a better shape, not even close.  Employment rate had a free fall, even with recent recovery, it‚Äôs still far worse than before, not better at all.  GDP growth had a free fall, unseen since the Great Depression.  This quarter doesn‚Äôt look good either.***Do these people know that the policy always gets more controversial second term?***Oh no Trump is gonna steal my gays! /s***Ugh, this is bad.

>You still have your gays

I don't know what the expectations were, but Trump's done nothing but rollback LGBT rights.

>You don't live in a FEMA camp

Is life in a FEMA camp worse than Trump's migrant detention centres?

>You don't live under nazi rule.

It isn't ""Nazi rule,"" but Trump *is* still actively trying to dismantle democracy and the rule of law in your country, which was a major feature *of* Nazi rule that people had a problem with.

> There are still no death panels

This was a term related to Obama's healthcare plan, right? The monopolized healthcare industry in the USA has people dying from lack of insulin, something given for free in other countries.

The pandemic has meanwhile killed *hundreds of thousands of Americans*. South Korea had their first case at the same time but the SK government actually did something about it and their death toll was 421. Trump lied to the public, encouraged people to do things to exacerbate the problem, and suggested just giving up and letting it infect everybody. Then his psychotic son-in-law deliberately chose to do nothing because he figured it'd harm Democrat-run states worse and they could spin the issue by blaming the Governors. Is this better than ""death panels""?

>tax cuts hasn't ruined your life

Tax policies don't ruin anyone's life directly, but the wording is facetious so I guess that's not the point. Trump campaigned as being a voice for the middle class that was being left behind by globalization and getting the short end of the stick in bad trade deals. Then the Republicans promised their new tax plans would help the middle class, framing it as a middle-income tax cut. This was a lie, it was just an egregious wealth giveaway to the rich.

>you've seen the tax returns

Trump's tax returns? We've only seen this partially so far, but it's already pretty much exactly what people expected, showing signs of fraud and preexisting financial obligation on the form of massive debt.***I thought FEMA camps and Death Panels was Obama's thing?***The economy is in much better shape?

That‚Äôs not the thought process of these people.  They are of the mindset of they can‚Äôt vote for someone they don‚Äôt like personally, even if it‚Äôs in their best interest. Which is why smear campaigns work.***Why does this look like a ransom note***Oh yeah, the economy is in great shape!

Oh wait***I mean this administration did pass some sketchy shit letting medical/healthcare professionals decide if they don‚Äôt want to provide care to a trans person even in emergent situations. This has lead to some (albeit few) deaths. I can understand regular visits I guess but emergent situations cmon, roll your sleeves and save a life instead of worrying about catching the gay.***When the meme has bad grammar you know a Trumper posted it.***Death panels were a claim made when Obamacare was being debated but I did see doctors in Texas essentially choosing who was going to live or die a couple months ago when their hospitals filled up.***Man O man. You can say the same about Obama. After 8 years of Obama, you still have your religious freedom, you still have your guns, you still have your capitalism, you don‚Äôt live under fascist rule and the economy was saved from depression and had the best growth. So you can admit you were fooled?

Also, you didn‚Äôt have an administration/campaign whose multiple officials were convicted with crimes, you didn‚Äôt lose 200K fellow citizens to pandemic, you didn‚Äôt have a trade war, you didn‚Äôt have world leaders making fun of your president, you didn‚Äôt have president who won‚Äôt denounce white supremacy, you didn‚Äôt have president who don‚Äôt pay fair share of tax or couldn‚Äôt show his tax return and so on and on. Most importantly you didn‚Äôt have a president that won‚Äôt commit to peaceful transfer of power which that is the bedrock of democracy.***Since when is the economy in better shape?***Someone tell me how tax cuts ruin your life.***They'd have to admit that they were wrong at the same time, and we know they sure as hell aren't going to be doing that anytime soon.***What about global warming...***All this minus the ‚Äúeconomy is in better shape‚Äù.

Winning!***No, never.***Isn't this an anti-Qanon meme?***I think that they would rather post pictures of men kissing.***Thanks for not killing all the gays?

I don‚Äôt live in a camp, but many Americans and immigrants do live in camps right now.

There‚Äôs no death panels, but there is literally multiple forms of genocide in said camps according to the UN‚Äôs definition of genocide.

We‚Äôve seen the tax returns and it‚Äôs exactly what we all were saying. He pays less tax than people in poverty.

The economy looks good because trump enacted several plans that sacrificed life and literally printed tons of money causing mass inflation to make the stock market not crash. His cure was worse than the disease.

Yes, we‚Äôre not all dead and he doesn‚Äôt outright call himself a nazi, but I think we should have higher standards.***No they would rather just keep ignoring positive changes and bash him for being a so called racist and fascist. 2 words that they don‚Äôt actually understand of course***The layout of this is painful***It's great that gay people still have permission to exist thought they might just all disappear***Pff, no. The only people noree stubborn that Republicans are democrat.***I hope so***Fascism in 2020 = tax cuts, prison reform helping minorities, first President to have an openly gay cabinet member, reversed Obama HBCU funding cuts, putting up a woman to the supreme court, not overstepping his power with states during a pandemic (when he probably should of because of their stupidity), etc.

Too bad Trump will be a one term POTUS.***Don't forget the endless wars, droning of innocents and all the foreign entanglements he dragged us into.  Not.***This is a poorly photoshopped conservative version of the ""after 4 years of Obama"" meme. 

Fema camps and death panels were related to him. The first one said guns and not gays. 

The media is focused on controversy and fear. So it doesn't surprise me that this meme works the other way after a few edits.***This is some Facebook boomer shit bruh***They just call it gaslighting.***Trumps not a saint. Also no president has ever been perfect, but that‚Äôs what they want perfect or nothing unless it‚Äôs a democratic president.***No, just like when Net Neutrality was brought up again after being forgotten about for years, they'll come up with an excuse about how it's still bad even though literally nothing happened.


The funny thing is, they're like this on so many topics, but pretend like anything bad for Democrats is a right wing conspiracy. Conservatives can admit when their leaders fuck up, and conservatives have mostly been level headed about Trump.

NBC would not lie***We need to go out to the polls and vote in person. Even the ballot harvesting will have no chance to make it close!***The left will just point to polls that have Biden at +10 or +14 no matter how unrealistic they are.

I wouldn't trust any poll right now. It's true that Zogby and Rasmussen will likely more accurately portray the level of Trump's support (likely because their reputation makes Trump's supporters more likely to be honest with them), but both have Republican house effects. Most of the other polls are just off in cloud-cuckoolander territory, predicting an electorate that is 40+% registered Democrat and 20% black. Part of that is Trump voters lying (and those results are probably what you'd expect if the pollster just said 'screw 'em' and did as little weighting as possible out of spite) and part of it is that every other major polling firm has Democrat house effect (A 'house effect's is a bias likely caused by the wording of questions and methodologies that makes one party poll consistently better than the mean).

Just ignore them for now. There is always static, but too much seems 'off' by what you're seeing to trust any of them, even the ones you'd like to.***Zogby poll, oof***Is Zogby a good poll?

A lot of people don't understand how elections work. I've seen people claim that since Democrats were doing well in the general party matchups (almost as well as in 2018!) the Democrats were going to gain even more seats. But that's not how it works at all. Every seat is up at every election. Getting almost as much support as last time will almost always lead to losses, not gains, no matter how high that level of support is.

Had they been talking about the Senate, it would have at least made sense. But this person specified the House.

The problem with these wave elections over the last decade is that they always lead to another wave for the other side in an election or two. Dems pick up a ton in 2006 and 2008, then lose big in 2010.

j58dyt,"r/Michigan is going crazy. A sub I use to love and enjoy actual michigan things of has gone full blown r/Politics.***>  **Article:**

Michigan‚Äôs one-woman rule is no more. When the coronavirus hit the state this spring, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer drew complaints for the seemingly arbitrary nature of her lockdown orders. Stores were told to cordon off nonessential sections. You could buy lottery tickets, but not paint or gardening supplies.

Those rules have eased, but Ms. Whitmer extended Michigan‚Äôs state of emergency again last week, this time through Oct. 27. In a Friday opinion that limits the Governor‚Äôs emergency powers, the Michigan Supreme Court quoted Montesquieu: ‚ÄúWhen the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty.‚Äù

Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat, has acted under two state laws. The Emergency Management Act lets the Governor declare a disaster, but only for 28 days unless a longer period is approved by the Legislature. In this case, Republican lawmakers declined to authorize any declaration past April 30. Ms. Whitmer‚Äôs response, the high court said in its opinion, was to end the first emergency and immediately declare a new one ‚Äúfor the identical reasons.‚Äù

The law says the Governor ‚Äúshall‚Äù issue a declaration ‚Äúif he or she finds that an emergency has occurred,‚Äù so Ms. Whitmer argued, as the court explained it, that she ‚Äúhad no choice here but to redeclare a state of emergency.‚Äù But as Justice Stephen Markman wrote for a unanimous court on this point, ‚ÄúTo allow such a redeclaration would effectively render the 28-day limitation a nullity.‚Äù

A second state law, the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act, says Ms. Whitmer can take ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù action as needed ‚Äúto protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation within the affected area under control.‚Äù As an illustration of its scope, the court said that Ms. Whitmer‚Äôs orders have required residents to stay home; mandated masks; forced the closure of churches, cafes, salons, gyms, schools, libraries and so forth; prohibited nonessential travel; and barred private gatherings between people from different households.

Unlike the other law, this one includes no specific time limitation, so in theory the Governor‚Äôs emergency powers could continue indefinitely. ‚ÄúAlmost certainly,‚Äù Justice Markman wrote for the majority, ‚Äúno individual in the history of this state has ever been vested with as much concentrated and standardless power to regulate the lives of our people, free of the inconvenience of having to act in accord with other accountable branches of government.‚Äù In a 4-3 vote, the court struck down the statute as ‚Äúan unlawful delegation of legislative power‚Äù under Michigan‚Äôs constitution.

Credit to the plaintiffs‚Äîa group of health providers and a patient needing knee surgery‚Äîfor challenging the Governor‚Äôs initial ban on nonessential procedures, as well as to the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, which provided legal firepower.

What now? ‚ÄúRepresentative democracy should not go away in a crisis‚Äîthat‚Äôs exactly when it‚Äôs needed most,‚Äù the Detroit News said last week. If Ms. Whitmer isn‚Äôt on the phone with lawmakers ‚Äúto begin working on a plan for cooperatively managing Michigan through the pandemic, she‚Äôs derelict in her duty.‚Äù

There‚Äôs little sign she cares to deal with the Legislature. ‚ÄúIt is important to note that this ruling does not take effect for at least 21 days,‚Äù the Governor said Friday. ‚ÄúMany of the responsive measures I have put in place to control the spread of the virus will continue under alternative sources of authority that were not at issue in today‚Äôs ruling.‚Äù What was it again that Lord Acton said about absolute power?***Good.

3. Cause friction between Russia and China, covertly or otherwise.
4. Outlaw Communism in the US.
5. Completely overhaul our education system. I'm talking massively overhaul it.

* All foreign citizens must not be allowed to teach in our schools.
* All foreign money donations to our academia need to be tracked and if need be, intercepted/canceled if they are deemed a threat to national security.
* Set national standards for curriculum that teach the TRUTH of American history. These standards will only be amended every 10-20 years or so.

The founding fathers all have incredible stories. Especially George Washington. Public schools don‚Äôt teach you enough about him, going from ‚Äúmiddle class nobody‚Äù to convincing the army he should have his brothers post, to starting the French and Indian war. 

The French and Indian war then lead to higher taxes on the colonies, the colonies eventually had enough and Washington was made commander of the army. Weird how 1 guy was directly the cause of 1 war, which indirectly caused the 2nd. Even weirder how he was the solution at the resolution.

So could it be that our education system sucks and doesn‚Äôt teach us how cool intricate and intertwined these stories are?

I'm gonna come right out and say that I agree wholeheartedly. 

That's actually the beauty of the deceleration of independence and the constitution and the founding ideals. Centuries ago these men laid out a premise that is still relevant today and that we still have not achieved. That's the definition of a philosophy that stands the test of time.

>	My name is Tony Bobulinski. The facts set forth below are true and accurate; they are not any form of domestic or foreign disinformation. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and offensive. I am the recipient of the email published seven days ago by the New York Post which showed a copy to Hunter Biden and Rob Walker. That email is genuine.
>
>	This afternoon I received a request from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs and the Senate Committee on Finance requesting all documents relating to my business affairs with the Biden family as well as various foreign entities and individuals. I have extensive relevant records and communications and I intend to produce those items to both Committees in the immediate future.
>	
>	I am the grandson of a 37 year Army Intelligence officer, the son of a 20+ year career Naval Officer and the brother of a 28 year career Naval Flight Officer. I myself served our country for 4 years and left the Navy as LT Bobulinski. I held a high level security clearance and was an instructor and then CTO for Naval Nuclear Power Training Command. I take great pride in the time my family and I served this country. I am also not a political person. What few campaign contributions I have made in my life were to Democrats.
>	
>	If the media and big tech companies had done their jobs over the past several weeks I would be irrelevant in this story. Given my long standing service and devotion to this great country, I could no longer allow my family‚Äôs name to be associated or tied to Russian disinformation or implied lies and false narratives dominating the media right now.
>	
>	After leaving the military I became an institutional investor investing extensively around the world and on every continent. I have traveled to over 50 countries. I believe, hands down, we live in the greatest country in the world.
>	
>	What I am outlining is fact. I know it is fact because I lived it. I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family. I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden. The reference to ‚Äúthe Big Guy‚Äù in the much publicized May 13, 2017 email is in fact a reference to Joe Biden. The other ‚ÄúJB‚Äù referenced in that email is Jim Biden, Joe‚Äôs brother.
>	
>	Hunter Biden called his dad ‚Äòthe Big Guy‚Äô or ‚Äòmy Chairman,‚Äô and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing. I‚Äôve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I‚Äôve seen firsthand that that‚Äôs not true, because it wasn‚Äôt just Hunter‚Äôs business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line.
>	
>	I realized the Chinese were not really focused on a healthy financial ROI. They were looking at this as a political or influence investment. Once I realized that Hunter wanted to use the company as his personal piggy bank by just taking money out of it as soon as it came from the Chinese, I took steps to prevent that from happening.
>	
>	The Johnson Report connected some dots in a way that shocked me ‚Äî it made me realize the Bidens had gone behind my back and gotten paid millions of dollars by the Chinese, even though they told me they hadn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt do that to their partners.
>
>	I would ask the Biden family to address the American people and outline the facts so I can go back to being irrelevant ‚Äî and so I am not put in a position to have to answer those questions for them.
>	
>	I don‚Äôt have a political ax to grind; I just saw behind the Biden curtain and I grew concerned with what I saw. The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled China.
>

This will be damn interesting.***wtf this is insane. How is there not massive outrage?***Have to assume the DNC knew about all of this. It‚Äôs seeming more and more realistic that they actually want Kamala.***This should be front page everywhere, you couldn't write a Hollywood script better than this.***I am kinda surprised that reddit hasn't banned this story.  Yet....***And just as soon as Trump mentions Hunter's name at the debate his mic will be muted.***They impeached Trump for far less. This has been rumored for years and is now finally confirmed. The Biden‚Äôs are corrupt, the media is corrupt, the DNC is corrupt, and Big Tech is corrupt. This needs to be spread across the country; I don‚Äôt want to live in a country that bows to the Chinese Government.***Can someone direct me to where I can get the full story to this? Ive been out of the loop for a little now******Tony Bobulinski real

Signature real.

Laptops real.

Emails real.

Child porn real.

Secret Service records real

Travel records real.

Corruption real.***Twitter is STILL blocking the NY Post for posting their original story which is now confirmed by the DOJ, FBI, DNI, Delaware State Police, and the Delaware Attorney General.

Now we have it confirme~~r~~**d** by people ON the emails in question.

Andrew Breitbart was right. War.

*Edit: Typo****all my liberal friends don't know anything about this stuff. It's terrifying that such big news can be hidden away for this long now***Biden has to win to save Obama's legacy. Another 4yrs of Trump and every corrupt thing that happened under Obama will be exposed. That might explain why they want to burn everything down if they don't win.***Over the last few years the Times and the Post have switched places***Is it my imagination or has anyone else noticed that as more evidence is exposed, we are getting fewer arguments from the other side?***How is r/politics taking this? Because they refuse to believe it***Hmmmm go figure. Always wondered why every major industry relocated in China.***Could you imagine how excited CNN (and all the mainstream and social media) would be if this news were instead about Trump and his son? It would literally be nonstop coverage every day leading up to the election, with panel after panel pointing to it as a legitimate reason why Trump can't be President.

But since it's Biden, they either completely ignore it or report it as ""false"". The mainstream media have shown in the past that they are the propaganda wing of the Democratic Party, but this is so blatant that I'm not sure how anyone can deny it.***It may be possible that the social media networks jumped the gun on what they perceived to be the ""October Surprise"".
  
Now that that's backfired - and it may not have been the surprise - they've got little ammo left.***I always found it a strange coincidence that a virus came from China after Trump put tariffs on China.  Kinda weird.***‚ÄúWhy make millions when you can make...billions?‚Äù -Joe Biden, probably***Still blows my mind that they impeached the President for Biden‚Äôs crimes.***The brigade is here to suppress this story***Meanwhile the only thing we‚Äôre hearing about it in the UK is how Giuliani is denying the Borat clip

Even the BBC is using the word ‚Äúrushed‚Äù in their article on ACB***Democracy for Sale.***Has this been verified by Huffpo yet***Good thing he isn‚Äôt the Clinton‚Äôs friend or he would‚Äôve committed suicide already like their other 60 friends we know about.***Frame that!***The left don't care.  They gonna vote Joe because when he's removed from office, they get the ho.***NYP's still blocked by Twitter.***The computer also had child porn on it..***I find it hilarious that it looks like a dollar store tabloid***Democrats don‚Äôt give a fuck, they‚Äôre okay with a lying cheating corrupt career politician telling them what to do. They‚Äôre on the side of Hollywood elite, big tech, main stream media, etc. they don‚Äôt care about the common man. Only what those groups tell them to think.***Propaganda press strategy: Ignore until early voting ends.***Too bad that regular people have a different set of laws compared to the crony elite establishment.***My question is why would the Chinese pay them in 2017 when they‚Äôre no longer in power?***I am obviously a conservative..but if this is true .. Biden didn‚Äôt do this while in office..***KER FUCKING BLAMMO

FUCK YOU LEFTIST FILTH******With the liberal press, big tech censorship and ""Russian disinformation"" garbage out there, who feels like we're living in communist China all of a sudden?  I feel like we've lost our country and didn't even see it disappearing. 

Please vote. TRUMP 2020!***Less than 250,000 read the NYP daily. Too bad.*** In a recent interview, Trump was noted saying ""I love cock, believe me. I suck a gentlemans cock and he says, you know, 'Donald, where did you learn to suck cock so well'. It's just in my genes, I have the best cock sucking genes. I see a tremendous cock and there's no fear, no fear. People say- and I've talked to a lot of people- they say no one sucks cock like Donald Trump. I'll tell you- they love me. They all love me.""***I still can't believe of all places the New York Post is the only ones reporting the truth to people***So democrats are the ones that supplied the laptops.  They had the FBI sit on it.  They figured either Giuliani would get impatient and leak it or that they would leak it right before the election.   They want Biden to win but hey want his name smeared through the mud.  Twitter blocks the story knowing full well it will cause a mass outrage and the story will spread like wildfire.  Meanwhile Pelosi is setting the groundwork to get rid of Biden when he wins.  Putting together a committee to invoke the 25th and saying it's because of Trump.  She knows full well Pence would never sign on for that so it's obviously a ruse to get Biden out after the election.  They will make Harris the president and be able to have a massive power grab to ensure the GOP is squashed forever.  They saw how how unpopular she was during the Primaries and although they wanted her they knew she would never win.  So they pushed Biden knowing he could be easily manipulated because of his obvious Dementia.  

If Biden wins he won't make it 6 months.  They will then push for 2 new states and 2-4 more supreme court justices.  With the Filibuster gone the republicans won't be able to fight back.  All they'll be able to do is sit helplessly as the Dems destroy our democracy.  We will see Republican majority states try to fight back but with the Judiciary now held by the Dems they will lose once it gets to the supreme court.  I would not be surprised to see multiple states try to secede and fail.  I don't see how this doesn't lead to an actual civil war.***Finally!***I wish it would make a difference, but I'm afraid nothing will sway those that vote for the only purpose of getting orange man out of office. 

Show them proof the Bidens are cannibals and their reaction would be the same: who cares?***And to add to the verification of all this, as if that's still in doubt.  Frank Luntz confirmed the validity of the email exchanges released between he and Hunter Biden.

These two large sets of emails (one from Hunter's hard drive and the other from his China partner) are the real deal, and those in the MSM who are ignoring it are burying themselves.***I do want to see evidence while biden was still in office. Although i can see this deal happening prior to 2017 and he getting paid for it when out of office.***Meanwhile r/politics mods: tHIs IS nOT AbouT MoDERn pawlITicSsS!!!***This really should be the end of Joe Biden's campaign for president, but knowing democrats it won't be.***ThE nEw YoRk PoSt Is UnReLiAbLe***Looks like another non-story.

nuts when I see articles or hear it from the people themselves about their (primarily) Trump yard signs or flags being removed or stolen. Just be civil. Just because you vote for A or B doesn‚Äôt mean youre a Nazi or racist or incompetent, it means you‚Äôre supporting a candidate and party and you have to have respect for the other side as well. But keep in mind that other side might be your co-workers or neighbors, even family maybe. So when people learn you vote left or right and they start out by saying ‚ÄúOMG, how could you, I can‚Äôt even talk to you, so you‚Äôre basically racist then?‚Äù My respect levels for that person go to rock bottom. If someone votes left, I say great, good for you, I‚Äôm not here to convince you otherwise, and guess what, I can still befriend them and have a conversation with them about normal life.***We need more of this.

Good quote I heard somewhere***Politics as a whole has divided America. It‚Äôs good to see that not every Biden supporter is a rioting maniac***Here here. Watch more Krystal & Saagar

And I honestly believe this is 98% of the population. It's the 2% that have been radicalized by social media and use social media to amplify their voice that is the issue.

Signs in his yard and everything. The rest of my neighborhood is mostly Trump supporters. We always say hi and wave to each other. Seems like the only places these violent confrontations occur is where conservatives are the minority. MSM propaganda has really sent people into a frenzy thinking that all Trump supporters are evil racist Nazis or whatever. If you ask anyone who actually lives around Trump supporters, and is basically forced to interact with them just because of their proximity, we aren‚Äôt nearly as bad as the media and democrat candidates would have you believe. I honestly believe that if the signs/support in my neighborhood were reversed, that my neighbor would be in serious danger, and that‚Äôs tragic, if you ask me.***You‚Äôll never see a post like this on THAT sub, you know the one.***This photo SPEAKS***There **are** good, ignorant people supporting Biden/Harris. Americans who don't know any better or simply believe the lies they're told by the media, celebrities, propagandists, or megacorps. That said, fundamentally, the core of policies being pushed by the Biden/Harris campaign are deleterious, life-threatening, un-American, illegal, & unequivocally hateful.

jfyhfk,"It‚Äôs more incredible than you might think because when Trump was running most people‚Äôs biggest concern about him was how he would handle foreign policy since he had no political experience.***Trump managed the broker one of the largest middle-east peace deals in history, hasn't started a single war, and has comitted to bring troops home.

He would absolutely wipe the floor with Biden on foreign policy, all he needs to do is bring up Biden's drone strike happy Obama and compare it to everything he did that i listed. Which is why they removed foreign policy from the debate, because it would make Biden look bad.***I think the answer is simple.

Whatever they may ask, Trump can say,‚Äùwell, I already adressed that in the last debate/townhall, and this is what we are doing in foreign policy right now.‚Äù

Its not like candidates sont already do this to a degree anyway.***There is a fucking azerbaijan armenia conflict everyone on the planet is talking about it except in America where the main issue is orange man bad.***When Biden is asked about foreign policy he's gonna talk about Obama, Trump should ask him about all the drone strikes and men lost to wars over nothing.***I'm actually pretty pissed this changed.

For once, I agreed.***Don't forget about higher taxes too!***But Biden/Harris have a solution built into their program to transform the country . Where the money will come from to pay for it is another story.

* Increased regulation and expansion of government oversite will create high paying government jobs
* Ending ""Right to Work"" will create union demanded inefficiencies, creating additional jobs.
* The mandatory service proposed will employ all young people of a certain age in government funded jobs.
* Free college and generous government subsidies and a general expansion of the welfare state will remove many from the workforce.***I'm all for helping people but this isn't the way to do it. We already see companies struggle with this, or work around it by limiting hours to avoid paying out healthcare, automating jobs to have less workers, or just straight up struggling to stay afloat like many restaurants. 

There is no guarantee that if you work 40 hours you are entitled to being able to afford housing and a car by yourself. These are starter jobs, not jobs you can make a career out of. If you want to stay there, then get a roommate or 2, or a side hustle... 

Housing though is a different story. Its in a horrible state in the US. I wish we had an answer for standardized rent costs, less costs for home ownership, and lower property taxes (or maybe you stop paying property tax after X years).***15 dollar inflation increase****Yeah increasing pay without increasing output is always a good recipe lol...

Remember Bernie's staff complained about not receiving $15 minimum? As a response Bernie's campaign *did* pay their workers $15 an hour, but cut their hours and worked them harder in those hours. Staffers were saying ""things were better off before...""

Yea... ya don't think?

These fucking libs don't understand that this would either harm the quality of goods and services to maintain staff at that rate, reducing customer satisfaction and therefore customer's that would continue spending their money; or, to maintain quality, it would take a cut directly out of their own hours if they're luck enough to keep their job... 

If only they offered like... Econ 101, or something, in these universities.***You can't fool supply and demand.***Minimum wage hike universally across the board makes no sense. For example, if you live in New York City or San Francisco, $15 is still destitute and absolute poverty. However, where I live in Arizona, that would put you in the top 25% of all jobs because the cost of living is very low here (you can buy a less than 10 year old 2000 sq foot home for 225k here in a decent non-ghetto neighborhood) and $15 an hour would send probably half of every mom and pop shop out of business, that is, after prices rise on everything as they try to keep up with the increase in wages.

Minimum wage laws should be set regionally, by the people's own states, not federally, imo. It makes zero sense and is just a fake talking point for votes.***People who think raising the min wage is good don't understand basic economics. So am I gonna get an equivalent pay raise too?

It says 3rd degree murder, or murder without intent, is rarely charged because it is usually charged as manslaughter, which the defendant is also charged with. The judge likely just removed the charge because it was redundant.

Also the Post's version says:  
>In his 107-page ruling, Cahill maintained it was his job to ‚Äúview the evidence in the light most favorable to the state,‚Äù and the jury‚Äôs job to determine the guilt or innocence of the ex-officers.

However, I am certain the judge was only talking about the position he must take when evaluating this motion, not his role in the trial overall. When considering motions to dismiss the judge has to take the position of assuming all of the plaintiff/prosecutor's facts are correct and then evaluate the case based on the law as applied to those facts, because if he were to rule in the defense's favor it would be like saying ""even if everything the prosecutor says is true, they could not get a conviction based on the law, so there is no point in going to trial on this issue.""***Should drop all of them***This is great news.

""\[Whoever\] causes the death of a human being **with intent** to effect the death of that person or another, but **without premeditation**, is guilty of murder in the second degree.""

The State will have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Derek Chauvin **intended** to kill  George Floyd during his arrest.  I think that claim is a bit of a stretch.   
The defense will argue that by the fact that an ambulance was called, whether or not Chauvin disregarded protocols during the arrest, autopsy, toxicology, bodycam footage, etc, he never once exhibited any intent to kill Floyd.

In my opinion, there is little, if any, evidence to indicate Derek Chauvin intended to kill George Floyd, hence why he will walk on the 2nd Degree Murder charge.

But it won't, because no one on the left will see it.***The left hates Trump with a passion.  His re-election is among the worst things that could happen, they truly believe that.  

Considering the political affiliation of the majority of people who make editorial decisions for NPR, covering stories that make Biden look bad or Trump look good are off the table, if they can justify it somehow.   

Liberal journalists are disproportionately sympathetic to stories that promote liberalism.  And they will take certain angles in their work that reflect their liberalism as well.  

Does anyone really doubt it?  Are people actively saying NRP or the NYTimes or WaPo don't lean left regarding their employees?   If so, is anyone arguing that those liberal reporters present news in a way that is just as sympathetic to conservative ideas as liberal ones?***That is the most absurd thing I have seen in biased media***If it‚Äôs such a non story shouldn‚Äôt they run a article detailing how it‚Äôs all fake?

WHAT A BOSS MOVE, PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!***I clicked through about a dozen places on the time bar and literally every single time she was trying to interrupt and talk over him.  Was this an interview or a debate?***When did journalism turn into straight up activism? And how are so many people ok with that?***FFS, why does Leslie keep interrupting him?  I know you have to ask follow-up questions, but at least let him finish his thoughts.  Geeze.***that was very frustrating and surreal.***Lmao, in the early release of the Mike Pence interview she keeps going on and on saying ""Why did he walk out?""

They gave them a 5 minute warning and asked if they wanted to do another one? And he goes ""I think we're done here."" They agree. Lmfao, she was trying to create soundbytes that he stormed out. They were already spreading rumors that Trump stormed out of the interview. All lies. Trying to create a narrative, not ethical journalism. She's a total disgrace.

Video shows that to be completely false. There's a reason Trump is releasing this in full. She also straight-up said they were going to cut the stuff he said about his campaign being spied upon and the Biden corruption stuff. She told him she wasn't going to show unverified stuff, like somehow she still is claiming the spying on his campaign wasn't true. What!? Thesr people are insane.

Dishonest journalism.***Around the 20 minute mark Leslie Stahl claims:

Biden is not in the middle of a scandal right now.

That the Senate Republicans have already investigated ""this.""  Which is flat out ridiculous considering the scandal is over a Hunter Biden laptop with emails on it, that the Senate never had access to, and is currently requesting access to from the FBI.

That 60 minutes ""cannot report on things it cannot verify.""  Despite the fact that the FBI and the DNI have verified this has nothing to do with Russia or a disinformation campaign.  Despite the fact that the repair shop has Hunter Bidens signature, email from Hunters lawyer, and record of a call from his lawyer, emails on the laptop that contain images of Hunter, emails that have been verified by people CC'd on them, etc...***‚ÄúWhat about the plot to kidnap governor Whitmer. Your supporters see you coming after her and look what happens.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt come after her. My DOJ is the one investigating her and helping her. I‚Äôve critiqued her, but I haven‚Äôt come after her.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt critiquing her coming after her?‚Äù 

Wow so... having discourse or argument about what‚Äôs best for the country and the constituency is now ‚Äúcoming after someone‚Äù? Critiquing a politician is slander now... got it. Nightmare universe. Very Orwellian. Seems pretty fascist to me.***‚ÄúWe had the best economy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know that‚Äôs not true.‚Äù

The numbers and even a lot of leftists said it was. Guys like Bill Maher called for a recession because he knew it was the *only* way Trump could lose, because it was going so well.***Hot take: The Trump team planned to cut the interview short and eventually show it unedited. This is why they only agreed to do it if they were able to record the whole. By Trump walking out (after most of the interview was done anyways) this would go viral. Knowing news of Trump cutting the interview short would go viral, this would set up the unedited interview to be watched instead of the highly edited version.***In this unedited footage, she comes off as borderline retarded, possibly demented.  Trump is laying out facts, even unpleasant ones, and she's just ""yeah but..."".  Editing is the magic that makes these people seem competent.***Notice how she was trying to stick ‚Äúrising cases‚Äù on him for like 3-4 minutes straight. When he finally acknowledged in some form she could barely contain herself, ‚Äúhigh cases? You said HIGH cases right right right???!!‚Äù Total sham attempt at trying to make him look bad.***He just needs to point out that huge percentages of the people testing positive for Covid are asymptomatic - and point out that the media doesn't explain this, which is, of course, a deliberate attempt to stoke peoples' fears.***Does this ""journalist"" gets her information from /r/politics? Jesus. Her ""You know it's not true"" after every verified fact was so irritating.

If we believe her, the stock market was crashed and everybody was unemployed, even before Covid. If we believe her, the democrats using federal agencies to spy on the Trump campaign is a hoax. If we believe her, Hunter Biden is a model child and there's never been a hint of potential corruption with him***I figured it went down like this, but I never expected it to have gone on this long. It‚Äôs vitriolic and desperate. 60 minutes should be ashamed.***I'm five minutes in and holy shit this is insane.

Hard hitting journalism is one thing but:

A) This interviewer is basically a ditsy dumb fuck liberal college girl interrupting the President of the United States every 2 seconds with r/politics \- level jabs

B) She would never bring this same demeanor to Biden or any other democrat, but if she did she would be fired instantly 

The number of institutions that still have credibility in this era grows smaller and smaller by the day***60 minutes calls that an interview? That was a debate and a biased one at that. The patience of the president to sit through that for almost 40min. Good lord these past 4 years have made the man invincible to the left.***He should have been doing this from the beginning.  A lot of underhanded stuff by the media could have been proven early on.***22 minute mark:

**Lesley**: Sir, can I say something? This is 60 Minutes and we can't put on things we can't verify.

**Trump**: Well, you won't put it on because it is bad for Biden.

ROFL, I spit my water after he said that.***Wow, she claims the Campaign Spying and Hunter laptop is not verified.  How about doing some actual journalism? Not even curious about it.  Very frustrating.***Trump embarrassed Leslie and the media with this interview.***Within the first minute of the interview starting.

LS: You know that's not true.

DJT: Schools her.

LS: Well I'm not gonna fact check.

Did crossfire hurricane not exist? 

Not only did they attempt to entrap a campaign member with $10k cash (papadapolous), they had fbi agents working against the executive with self-proclaimed ""insurance policies"" against the president, having these same corrupt agents working in the Mueller sham investigation, and ""investigating"" Hillary's email crimes. 

I wonder what that journalist would say to multiple Mueller lackeys ""losing"" their phone data via ""forgotten password"" resets, or that the FBI conveniently lost the texting conversations with Strozk because of a ""technical difficulty""***Fyi 60 minutes claiming Trump violated the agreement

CBS and Leslie Stahl are disgraceful but their behavior is no longer surprising. Once again we see the Media's open hostility and dishonesty when dealing with President Trump.  Leslie Stahl is a member of the Establishment Press and they live deep in the Swamp.  

FACT: Today's Establishment Press are corrupt, and yes, the 'enemy of the people'.***But this is only 30 minutes???!?!1!!1 what!1!1??1!1?11!  /s***So, this is the unedited version with LESS context than the highly edited version 60 minutes will/did release? We live in absolute clown world. This was like watching an r/politics user interview Trump. Pathetic. But what‚Äôs even more interesting (like a few users have already pointed out) is that this woman should not have the title of ‚Äújournalist‚Äù.

That healthcare section was weak sauce.***I can‚Äôt wait for the debate... I‚Äôm generally a democrat, but good lord does my current / former party and the media need a reckoning. This was nothing but a drive by.***This lady is brainwashed, she doesn't believe there is a scandal within the Biden family although there being copious amounts of evidence of Joe leveraging his Vice presidency, she doesn't believe that the DNC in a concerted effort with intel. agencies spied on the Trump campaign... like wtf!??? Are these people that big of idiots(hard to believe) or are they complicit? This is why the media has no credibility amongst rational thinking people.***She did nothing but defend Biden the entire time.***60 minutes is unwatchable!***Trump:  ‚ÄúThe media discredits themselves‚Äù
Interviewer:  ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù
Trump:  ‚ÄúBecause you don‚Äôt ask tough questions to Biden‚Äù

It will be immediately compared to this unedited version and their biases will be on full display.***Checkmate, Trump is at his best when playing 4D Chess, he KNEW this interview was going to be a sham job, that is why he insisted the WH record the full interview ""for archival purposes"".

Trump: ""and he's[Biden] in the middle of a scandal""
Lesley: ""he's not :-p he's not :-p no :-p come on :-p""

I think that's the most offensive part of the interview.  She's supposed to be a journalist, but she acts like Trump bringing up the email scandal (verified by NY Post and Fox News) is the silliest thing she's heard.  Like he just said he believes in the tooth fairy.***This universal blind hate for Trump from the establishment and the media just doesn't make sense to me. Yes he is a Narcissist and can be very crass and unpleasant to listen to. He can be very charismatic too. 

I don't believe the satanic children-sacrifising cult theory but I sure do think that he's fixing to blow something up that would implicate a whole bunch of politicians (both sides) and entertainers. Theres just no other way that their blind hatred can be justified.***Trump 2020***What would happen if Trump, or everyone on the Right, just stopped playing along with the Left's bullshit? Don't give interviews to these reporters who are just out there to play ""gotcha!"", don't do these debates where it's completely biased and they're just trying to make you look bad.***Oof. This was a rough watch.***Lesley Stahl sounds truly incompetent in this interview. She doesn‚Äôt seem to comprehend anything Trump is saying and then repeats her questions over and over. 
Trump nails the question about the economy and she can‚Äôt even form a rebuttal. It‚Äôs pure denial coming from her. 
About mask use, she doesn‚Äôt seem to understand when Trump repeats that he supports mask use. 
I was most surprised about her denial of the surveillance of the Trump campaign by the Obama administration. This is well-established fact. Carter Page, Crossfire Hurricane, Paul Manafort, etc. The fact she still tries to deny it really shows her true colours. 
Journalism is in a sad state in America.***You can really see how frustrated he‚Äôs become with leftist media bias. 60 minutes prayed that he wouldn‚Äôt release the unedited version, because it‚Äôs just going to show how they constantly twist his words.***What a whiny bitch, it's almost unwatchable.***What a f-ing rude interviewer. No one interviews Sleepy Hiden like this.***Is she crying for a little bit at 29:00 - 29:10 ? LOL, is there footage of that from Trump's PoV?***That interviewer was annoying***It's a good thing he released it early. Does it break the contract? I'm sure. But this is really close to election season. Allowing them to spin this interview would not be helpful.***Delusional woman. She is representative of the entire mainstream media. 

It goes like these with these delusional democrat party cheerleaders. One crackpot reporter says ""this laptop is not verified!"" and they all dutifully repeat this quote to each other until it becomes truth even after this laptop has been verified 6 different ways.***This interview has rubber stamped his win. If enough centrist types are this, they should finally realise the absolute BS trump puts up with from the media day in day out.*** This is he kind of stuff that benefits Trump and needs to be shared!***This is an important lesson for any public figure, especially a conservative. If you are ever interviewed by 60 minutes, or anyone else really, make sure you tape it yourself to show everything that they edit out.***So do you just have to say that orange man is bad to get a job at these media companies?***Oh man. Parts of that were painful to watch. I kept saying ""Let the man answer!"" The questions were phrased in such an obviously biased way that he was forced to unravel the questions for half the time.***Thats not true... well I am not going to fact check you..

jg4evs,"Just based on how angry the leftists of Reddit have gotten this week, I think they‚Äôre getting worried.***If this is a national poll and is accurate, Trump will win the electoral college. With that being said, take nothing for granted and vote.***Biden was never up by 12, I would say tied would have been more realistic.***One additional problem with the polls is how they‚Äôre weighted. We just saw Gallup report that 29% of people identify as republics and 28% identify as Democrats yet the polls are usually 35% democrat and 27%(ish) republican. No wonder it looks like Biden is ahead.***Now for the real story \_ Biden was never up 12%, ever, and hes not up 3% either.   These numbers showing Biden leading were all the result of 'Push Polls' that are designed to drive public opinion, not report it.   They represented the wishes of Democrats, not anything real.

Those of us who have been around a while and have seen this same story play out know how the game works. We saw the  the same Poll games with Reagan v. Carter and in fact its the same every election.  Ignore the hype, and the polls until the last week, and VOTE!

The truth is Biden/Harris are likely down by 2-5, depending upon how you weight the shy Trump vote.  Biden is not looking like a winner anywhere but the minds of fools and tools.***Crowder had an amazing segment last night on why Trump will win - and he showed how wrong the polling was in many swing states - like up to 13% wrong.  


The polling national average was close - but some swing states would have Hilary up 12% and then Trump won by 1%. Now obviously that was the extreme, not the norm, but it happened like that often enough in the places that mattered.

  
Add to that:   


&#x200B;

1. how the left has gotten noisier and more threatening, there is solid evidence that the polls are even more wrong - that even more Trump supporters are not answering or even outright lying - 
2. and now the Biden email scandal, which Biden isn't even defending against he is just sitting in his basement relying on the MSM and big tech to try to ignore or discredit it (which isn't working)

I'm optimistic he'll be on his game tonight.***I really hope Trump gives very brief answers and just changes the subject.  These are crap topics.***The fact they changed the topics off of foreign policy is protecting Joe from the laptop story,  which to me is full on election interference.  It's just so blatant.***A legit whistleblower not hiding behind anonymity just told the American Republic that one of its presidential candidates is on the Chinese Communist Party payroll and most of the media is not even covering this story.  What is this country?  Do you even have a country anymore?

There is a real witness who was involved personally with supporting hard evidence sourced from Biden's personal property, and the media is claiming ""This isn't verified.""

WOW***Sorry if this is slightly off topic. But I am new to Reddit and just came from r/politics and I am utterly shocked how liberal that page is. Isn‚Äôt it a page that should be able to openly discuss both left and right wing ideas? Any mention of trump or article post not from a left media source receives so much hate and downvoting. They‚Äôve taken over the page and are now claiming the liberal way is the only reality for the future of politics. Am I nuts or has anyone else noticed this?***I‚Äôll break it down how the questions will most likely go

1.) Fighting Covid: Mr. President do you regret your failure to address Covid?  VP Biden how would you fix Covid?

2.) American Families : Mr. President Under your leadership Americans are more divided than ever and have suffered greatly thanks to Covid what should you do? VP Biden how do you plan to help American families?

Race in America: President Trump do you support White Supremacy? VP Biden Why doesn‚Äôt Trump Disavow White supremacy?

Climate Change: President Trump why do you deny the science? VP Biden  tell us all about your green new deal 

National Security: President Trump there is a growing concern of White supremacist groups and militias carrying out attacks do you feel you encourage them? VP Biden Why have white supremacy groups grown how will you stop them?

Leadership: President Trump Why are you such a bad leader?  VP Biden why are you a good leader?***Why do they talk about climate change in every debate. All these topics are chosen to try to make President Trump look bad but he will do great.***Isn‚Äôt it just convenient that Foreign Policy won‚Äôt be discussed? Trump lands major peace deals and it comes out Biden abused his VP power in Ukraine. But we better stay away anything that will hurt Joe of course.***Looks like Biden will respond to all claims regarding Hunter that it is Russian disinfo. That will be hard with Tony sitting in the front row.***Trump needs to let Biden talk himself into a corner. If he can show a little bit of restraint not interjecting every other sentence he can get some good hits in, Pence-style. I don't have a lot of confidence in his ability to do this though.***Honestly I think I‚Äôm going to sit this one out and follow what‚Äôs going on here and catch the highlights later on Fox.

If he fights with the moderator or yells and tries to interrupt Biden like last time it will make him look bad to uneducated voters. All Biden has to do is stop talking and smile at the camera and give CNN footage to blast Trump with later. I don't think Trump listens to his advisors tbh***Trump just needs to hold back and let Biden answer.  People know what Trump has done. Biden has nothing concrete and speaks in ambiguities. It will be more evident the more he speaks.***If I were trump, I would just keep asking Biden about the Hunter story and/or court packing and yielding my time to let him answer. Well already know Trump‚Äôs policies, so it‚Äôs not really a loss if he doesn‚Äôt talk here.***Honest opinions does anyone even think this debate is going to make a difference either way?   Feel like everyone already has their mind up one way or another.

The debates are so rigged, but when I try to discuss that with left leaning friends, they avoid discussing it because they know it's true and like that it's true.***They should have included some foreign policy because that's important to the interests of Americans.

We've heard plenty on COVID19 leading up to the election and also racial discussions.

I'd have liked some foreign policy to round out the discussion.***Chris Coons trying to spin this scandal away from Biden is so funny. What an idiot***It won't happen, but how lit would it be if FBI agents came in and put Joe in handcuffs mid-response?***M: President Trump what does it feel like being a white supremacist?

Trump: what do you mean I havent even gotten a chance to -



M: President Trump your time is over we will now mute your mic. Ok VP Biden, you're plan to re-invigerate America is brilliant. Please comment on it.



Biden: I'm the good guy, Trump is the bad guy. My plan good, his plan bad. (Rants for 4 minutes).




M: President Trump you can now respond.




Trump: well, I think -




M: thank you President Trump, but your time is up.





*this is exactly what the debates gonna look like****‚ÄúAmerican families? Let‚Äôs talk about your family, Joe. You‚Äôve sold your country to its enemies to enrich yourself and your junkie son. I yield my time back to the cunt moderator.‚Äù

President Trump‚Äôs winning argument.***Each of these has one one key idea that Trump needs to focus his answer on and keep hammering.

> Fighting COVID-19

Biden literally has no plan other than doing what I've done, and telling states it'd be nice if they kept crushing the economy and individual rights. Biden doesn't actually have the power to implement the steps he vaguely criticizes me for not taking.

> American families

Biden used his drug addict son as a holding company for foreign graft. If he's that derelict in his personal life, imagine how he'll ruin your family. He wants to raise taxes on the overwhelming majority of Americans by repealing my tax cuts, and he wants to leave you at the mercy of BLM and Antifa rioters by taking your guns and hamstringing law enforcement.

> Race in America

The left wants to create a race war through repealing civil rights law in California, expanding affirmative action, paying reparations, and mandating white privilege training. This is not only a violation of the 14th Amendment, but it is bad for every American. Giving people special treatment for being non-white will, aside from stoking racial tensions, set up its beneficiaries for failure, and further a cycle of dependency for generations to come.

> Climate change

Biden endorses the Green New Deal in everything but name. We've seen from the California blackout that opposition to oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy causes brown outs and black outs, and we're supposed to spend trillions abandoning them for technology that can't meet even a fraction of current need? The only beneficiary of the Green New Deal in China, whose global power will rise as we destroy our own economy.

> National security

Whereas Biden helped further Iran's nuclear ambitions and gave billions to them, I have taken bold and historic action to punish Iran through sanctions, both directly and through their affiliates like Hamas. Whereas Biden helped worsen relations with Israel, I not only moved the embassy like Obama promised and never did, but I negotiated new peace deals for the first time in a generation. And I didn't start new wars, unlike Joe Biden, who in the Senate and as VP, never missed a chance to support sending American troops to die in pointless wars.

> Leadership

Biden is literally too senile to campaign. He has all but said Harris will be in charge. And Harris is proven to be incompetent and malicious. Unlike Biden, I'm functional. And unlike Harris, Pence would actually be a good President if anything happens.***I don't get why the hell foreign policy wouldn't be on the agenda. It is one area where the Trump administration undeniably has excelled***What trump needs to do is maintain a level head. Answer the questions and get everyone thinking ‚Äú oh, hes playing the game‚Äù then they relax on their censorship buttons. 

Finally,  on the national security question, he needs to drop the effin hammer on the corruption case.***Trump needs to keep his cool (near impossible, I know) and stay focused on his accomplishments, the economy, and yes, his foreign policy. Then tie that back to Biden‚Äôs deals with China, Ukraine, etc. Don‚Äôt bring up Hunter‚Äôs addiction, but bring up how he made Joe richer than ever by corrupt deals with foreign governments and businesses. That‚Äôs all. Oh, and he can say, ‚ÄúOur wonderful intel community has verified all that info that democrats and the media won‚Äôt talk about.‚Äù***I'll preface my comment by saying I have no real stake in any of this. And I'm not a leftist troll. I simply would like to ask something because I'm a bit confused, and genuinely would like to know. The Hunter emails are dated to 2017 when Biden wasn't vice president or running for president - so why would they be a sign of corruption, or be anything that should derail Biden's current presidential campaign?***I've always thought this Biden stuff was a big deal but it felt a little convoluted and I was worried too much attention would not be a benefit for Trump, but christ almighty how do you even reckon with this Bobulinski stuff.   Don Jr was right, Biden is the Loch Ness Monster of the swamp.***Hopefully the president just ignores these waste of time topics and covers his achievements and huge Biden corruption***Did TD get shut down?***It‚Äôs hard to imagine even wanting to participate as Trump with such media bias against him.***I voted for trump on saturday. Id rather watch Giants/Eagles game tonight.***Guaranteed the mute button will get misused against Trump. Afterwards, we‚Äôll get some empty apology and the commission will still get to pick overly biased democrats to moderate again in 4 years.***This election is Trump's to lose. After what happened with 60 minutes, it's imperative that he stays on message tonight and doesnt lose his cool.***If the Hunter Biden stuff is fake it's one of the most elaborate hoaxes of all time.***I think all Trump has to do is talk about the economy, small business optimism, treatments for the virus, and the fact that we need to take the virus seriously but not let it run our lives***I know that there is potential for shenanigans, but it actually feels very 2020 that the moderator might have to keep telling candidates 'you're on mute'. Feels like the catchphrase of the year.***i wont be able to watch while at work. anyone know when or where i can watch it in full after 11?***What is the best case scenario for trump?***watching ABC because rabbit ears, must be Biden's official campaign channel.***FYI, Crowder's pre-debate coverage starts within the next couple of minutes and will feature Don Jr. and Ted Cruz. 

I would also suggest those wanting post-debate coverage watch Nick Rekeita and Ty Beard.***Trump needs to perform well tonight. There's a delicate line being tuff on Biden for his faults (supreme Court/emails/gun grab) and coming off as a bully. The polls are moving in his favor now, and if he can do well tonight it'll only improve his chances of re-election.***""WHO PAID FOR YOU TO BE HERE!!!"" shut the fuck up***So much stuff trump could destroy Biden on ... Iraq war vote, trump pulled troops out, China stuff, wrote the crime bill that sent countless americans to jail..... 

Im just afraid he will only hammer the hunter stuff, when he could really slam home why joe Biden has harmed so many Americans via the crime bill, how he‚Äôs bringing the troops home. That stuff would resonate so much more than the hunter stuff...***This gonna be interesting***BAH GAWD it's a handicap match!***Your post says 8 PM Central, photo days 8 PM *Eastern****I'm in spain, anyone know what time It will start here?

From an outsiders point of view, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to understand what he means. ‚Äúcovid will just go away‚Äù = ‚Äúlife will go on and we can‚Äôt let something like this destroy all we‚Äôve worked for‚Äù. I‚Äôm not the brightest person, but if Trump could be more articulate and not leaving so many gaps to fill in mentally then he would do so much better with people like me. Anyways we‚Äôll see what‚Äôll happen but so many people have already voted it seems kinda late for this to make a big impact on voters.***Well, the Bidens are an American family, aren't they?***Robinette? hahahahah***I just hope they talk about policies and what the next 4 years would like like.

The FBI did not supeona the laptop in question until late 2019.  This is a completely different investigation and as far as I know when it started isn't public knowledge.

The FBI wouldn't have even know about the laptop unless the store owner told them about it.

How in the hell does Wallace figure the ""fruits"" of any investigation where a key piece of evidence was not even supeoned until late 2019 should have ""seen fruits"" by now?

Alternatively, of course, the FBI didn't actually take that long to complete the Russian investigation, but was mostly a political disruption entrapment campaign extended as long as they felt they could get away with it. 

I don't see Wallace admitting that either, though.***The FBI is shit. But that's ok, because Conservatives will do the job for them.

jgars6,">  **Article:**



As I write it is now the seventh day ‚Äî and a bare two weeks till the presidential vote ‚Äî that Twitter, Facebook and their co-operative partners in the television networks and mainline newspapers have smothered or refused to print or broadcast the devastating reports concerning the dealings of Hunter Biden and his father, presidential candidate Joe Biden.

The suppression of a major, no, an explosive and potentially result-changing news story by 90 per cent of the establishment media, is a journalistic crime.

It is the willing, the voluntary adoption by a (once) free press of the practice of information control that up to this period has been the hallmark, solely, of tinpot tyrannies, Communist governments everywhere, and most notably in the modern era the present information-throttling government of China.

It is an exhibition of blatant, undeniable and massive bias during the exercise of the most central event of every democracy ‚Äî the election of its leaders. A great swathe of the media of the United States is deliberately ‚Äî by refusing to exercise its proper function, and by acting as guardian and accessory to the campaign of its favourite, Mr. Biden ‚Äî nullifying its purpose, wrecking its prestige and standing with the public, and practicing the single largest dereliction of its democratic function since the founding of the republic.

All under the specious, hollow anti-morality of ‚ÄúIf it hurts Donald Trump, it is not only justifiable, but righteous.‚Äù

A child of five, or the mute beasts of the field would find tongue to tell you that if some equally potentially damaging story placed Donald Trump Jr. in its crosshairs and implicated his father, it would be crowding the screens of Facebook and Twitter; the Washington Post and the New York Times would have exhausted the nation‚Äôs supply of newsprint with special and interminable reports of its every minutiae; and television‚Äôs main talking-heads would be choking with the zeal to report it and damnify Trump.

Speaking of the Washington Post, recall its so sanctimonious motto: Democracy dies in darkness. Two weeks before a presidential election, the Washington Post and its rigorous editors have turned off the lights.

Should anyone want something of an honest, independent and clear view of what is happening, turn to the recent utterances of Jonathan Turley, a legal scholar, professor at George Washington University Law School, and frequent witness at U.S. Congressional proceedings about constitutional and statutory issues.

Prof. Turley is NOT a Trump supporter. He is something far more significant and singular in these partisan-insane times ‚Äî a fair and intelligent mind. Here‚Äôs just a few of his observations ‚Äî which up until recent days would be the views of everyone with the slightest understanding of democracy and a free press:

‚Äú‚Ä¶ The companies‚Äô actions are an outrageous example of open censorship and bias. It shows how companies effectively can become state media working for one party.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ The point is that free speech allows us to call out those who say false or reckless things without Twitter engaging in private censorship. As soon as these companies embraced censorship, it put social media on the slippery slope of biased and selective speech controls.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Despite a letter (signed by) dozens of former officials saying this is Russian disinformation, the FBI reportedly has confirmed that it has the laptop and it is not Russian disinformation‚Äù (my emphasis).

There are others of equal standing making the same points. I‚Äôd add a few of my own. Where are the journalism schools and their mentor-professors? Why are they not howling in outrage at a canonical violation of the standards of objectivity and fair-dealing, the hallmarks of an independent press?

Why are the journalistic associations of every democracy, so self-applauding at their annual shindigs, not condemning the iron hand of Big Tech in choosing what a free people may and may not see and post about? Big Tech deciding it must leverage an election?

There is so much more, but it surely should be enough just to note that we have here an open-and-shut case of journalistic failure, publicly enacted ‚Äî almost boastful in its blatancy ‚Äî and the great organs of the press float on as if nothing were unusual.

As a final note, this is obviously an American story. But give a thought to how much coverage the Canadian media have given to every Trump tale, and now ask where is the Biden equivalent. Check CBC or CTV, which has lived on Trump coverage, for coverage on Biden and son.

Also, once Big Tech finds it can run an election in one country, it will probably develop an appetite to run those in others.

And since Justin Trudeau is obviously agitating for an election in Canada (more on that next time) we should pay great attention to the grand mischiefs and sad practices being engineered by the Silicon Valley sultans to the south of us.***So infuriating.

A CFC refers to any company that is partly owned by a Chinese tax resident AKA. if the Biden's had a Chinese resident as a partner. If this guy was operating in china he would know that. transferring money from a company you own isn't illegal in most cases though there can be tax implications possibly.

If she had any bias ( which we know she has) it barely showed during the debate. She actually presed Biden for some follow up questions and while talking over trump sometimes while ha was defending himself , she actually allowed him time to respond without directly debating bim like Chris Wallace did. She deserves a promotion just for not being as incompetent as everyone else in the main stream media, and actually knowing how to act professionally.***This meme is total bullshit. Trump was given his entire time, and the moderators even turned his mic back on after it turned off so they could catch the rest of his statement. I felt, from a conservative leaning view, that Biden got wrecked in this debate by the prepared questions from the moderator. There were even specific examples of poor policy brought up by the moderator against Joe Biden. 

Don‚Äôt be fake news. That‚Äôs not what we are about here. That debate was fair, and if anything VERY beneficial to Trump‚Äôs re-election chances.

Note: I guess r/conservative does like their share of fake news since I am being downvoted for stating facts. I can only assume you watched a different debate than I did.***Disagree... I thought it was a very fair debate. You can argue over semantics and minor issues all you want. As a whole, I believe she was fair and actually facilitated debate and didn‚Äôt cut off either party often (Maybe once of twice each). 

I might get downvoted for this, but even Trump himself said she was very good and fair. Give credit where it‚Äôs due***I'm not going to lie ... I was really worried about Welker - but her letting Biden talk more might have been the greatest service ever performed for our country.***Obviously, she was biased but she wasn't as bad as Chris Wallace who works for FOX.***The first 15 minutes was wasted with the tired topic of covid. Might as well play the tape from the 1st debate. Nothing new, move along. C'mon man.***I don't get the hate she is getting. I thought she was was decent. She had some good folloq up that threw biden back and trump had to fight more to respond but nothing absurd compared to other moderators. Trump even complemented her.***Did you forget when one candidate talks over or interrupts during another candidate's time is taken out of the candidate who talked over them's time answer that's why Trump has ""10 seconds"" and Biden has ""30 second"".***She was *more* fair than I expected, *more* fair than the other people Trump's dealt with which is a plus for her. She was *vary* fair on Democrat terms, she did well. But she did attempt several times to debate Trump for Biden which is obviously not fair.***She did really well. This isn‚Äôt fair to her***She was miles better than the last moderators. I witnessed that too where she gave much leeway to Biden to respond which he of course wasted but Trump made the most out of his time even when he was being supressed.

Although its still sad that she had to be pressured into being an actual Moderate in terms of bringing up damning topics to Biden, rather than truly being a third party with no-bias. I‚Äôm saying that if she was the first moderator instead of the final one, that Biden by a margin would‚Äôve scored more points. The past two debates along with her history being brought up as an avid democrat brought some actual moderation to the table. I guess its the lesser of two evils.***She wasn't as bad as it could've been. But there were tons of times where she made it seem super urgent to move on when Trump wanted to respond, but then all of a sudden there was no rush when Biden was to respond. Also, she tried to quickly move on from the Hunter stuff almost on behalf of Biden, even when he wanted to respond to it. Yet when the subject was on Trump's dirt, like his taxes, there was all the time in the world.***The bias is constantly so obvious.***I felt she was unbiased and fair as she possibly could.. However it was also clear that she wanted to Boden the win the thing.*** Joe. I ran because of Barack Obama. You did a terrible job.

We know what you did Joe.******I saw a fact-checker say Joe didn't lie, because they didn't have an explicit policy of caging children.  Well, neither does trump.

Separating children is the law - it's called the Flores Consent Decree, and it's designed to keep minors separated from adults, so they're not preyed on in the detention centers***All politics aside, humans in cages is fucking an atrocity to mankind.***Now this is a quality meme.***Snopes rates as true: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-build-cages-immigrants/***String!

Nice!***The facilities were built for overflow and any kids who came with parents or legitimate guardians were reunited with them under Obama and those who came without legal guardians were placed in homes and tracked, not kept in cages and forgotten. The separation of children from their parents as a matter of policy was uniquely Trump's. Or rather Stephen Miller's, with the approval of Trump. Asylum seekers weren't treated as criminals under Obama. Children weren't ripped from their parents' arms and lost in an unnecessarily labyrinthine and indifferent system. Contrary to Trump's lying mouth in this debate the rate at which immigrants were released, given a court date and showed up was well over 90%, not the 1% he pulled out of his ass.

Remote monitoring also costs us a hell of a lot less than detention. Why would you want to house thousands of people and (pretend) to take care of their needs when a cheap ankle monitor program with near complete success already exists?

Don't worry, I already know the answer. The cruelty is the point. Y'all don't give a fuck about these people and only use the ""he built the cages"" to try to score points. You don't care that you are 100x more callous and corrupt and inhumane than your opponent. That is your entire ethos. Rules for thee, but not for me.***conservatives: Obama/Biden built the cages

jgdwf5,"I‚Äôve said this before; I can understand MSNBC, OAN, CNN and FOX all being heavily biased in their reporting.  They have sponsors that want them catering to a specific demographic, so they do...

NPR and PBS are funded by tax dollars.  Not just liberal tax dollars, but conservative tax dollars also.  Why should a conservative be forced to pay for these hacks who constantly shit on our president and call us racist?

I don‚Äôt know about defunding, but I‚Äôm 100% for regulating them. Give us neutral news with no opinion pieces and answering to a board of both conservative and liberal editors.***I'm supportive of this.  It's one thing for them to be left-leaning, which they always have been.

It's another thing to participate in a DNC coordinated media blackout of news that's harmful to their preferred candidate.

If the computer belonged to Eric Trump, they would report on it.  We  ALL know that's true.***Absolutely.  NPR brings no value and is simply a waste of tax dollars.***I agree NPR should be defunded but also think it is time to defund PBS.***We shouldn‚Äôt even need to give this as a reason. NPR stopped being relevant 35 years ago***All public radio should be defunded. All they do is race bait and have a heavy left wing agenda. I had to stop listening after they asked a nurse on a union strike if she felt discriminated against for being black. Bruh. She didn't even know what to say. She was like 'uh, maybe but I guess I can't tell'. 

I like kye Risdoll with marketplace, but you can just download his segment separately. Eventually I stopped listening to him even after the race baiters kept forcing him to bring up race in his market journalism.***Give their money to CSPAN.***I keep their politics podcast because I like to try and balance out what I listen to. I can tell you they‚Äôve gotten noticeably more one sided in their selection of topics and, at times, handling and off handed comments, since around May. It‚Äôs gotten absurd at times.***It's a good place to start, but the federal government should also look into defunding things like the atf, dept of education, energy, middle and upper management in every department, and foreign aide, for starters.***This has been a long time coming.  Stop the commies from using tax payer money to fund propaganda.***The one public source that should have been objective.***Good, they‚Äôve been a biased wreck for far too long***We live in some sort of bizarro world where the left screeches about defunding a radio station but demand defunding police.***Yes. The government should not be in the news publishing business...kinda defeats the whole idea of a media watchdog.***Keep in mind, these broadcasters are already funded. You would just be voting to remove the free money they get from tax payers that they don't have to work for or present ideas they don't agree with in order to get that funding. 

Of course it is mostly followed/funded by white liberal women. However, for some reason, they wanted to rope in Latinos and began agressively pursuing Latino prsenters and producers about 6 years ago. Deliberately targeting a specific population and tailoring content to them instead of trying to be uniting for all Americans. Kind of racist and ignorant.***# HELL TO THE YES!***There are a lot of people who regularly listen to NPR, and it shouldn't be removed... which is why it should instead be a private business not dependent on tax dollars.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you do it before?‚Äù IS an excellent question to ask a career politician, but in a debate you have to frame it like ‚Äúwe have no reason to believe him, he was VP for 8 years if he wanted to do it he would have done it before!‚Äù***Joe said a lot of stuff that she couldn‚Äôt even save him from last night.***She was terrific and threw hard ball questions at
both of the candidates.

For having her own biases, I think she was fantastic and gave Trump numerous opportunities to respond when he asked. She even let something get out that is extremely damaging to Biden.

Trump pointed out how much Hunter was earning working for a gas company in a foreign country with no experience. Joe didn't deny the amount and claimed it was completely ethical. Honestly, Trump missed the opportunity to demand that both Hunter and Joe's other family members release their tax returns. We already know that's how the money is hidden.

My point is, an undecided voter or anyone who could be shifted to Trump in someway, is going to have to reconcile the fact that Hunter was massively profiting off his dad as VP with zero experience and that Joe thinks that is ethical and a completely fine thing to do. You have to knowingly accept that you are voting for someone who will encourage foreign interference in our Government through their family. Trump on the other has his family on the Government payroll, literally working for the American people and American interests. So then it becomes, do you want want a nepotism problem (annoying but livable short term) or do you want a family that will sell out Americans to foreign entities (long term and potentially immediate damage)?***I thought she was good. Chris Wallace should be banned forever***Did you notice how she stopped and let old Joe speak every time he opened his mouth?  But, she constantly interrupted the President and tried to talk over him.  ‚ÄúWe have to move on.

It got really annoying she would cut off the president and say we have to move on then look at Biden and say go ahead and respond..***Ted Cruz on Crowder said it best

She was also really flexible overall, regarding Trump's interruptions. While she did give Biden a little bit extra time for like one question, she was rather objective. I also like how they were both able to respond to each other and have a back and forth, it made for a more fluid coversation/debate, something that was lacking from Wallace's more strict way of """"moderating"""" (in reality that debate was like the referee fighting in the ring as well).***I think she was ok, biased but the best so far, including 2016.***Is it just me or did the 2 minute rule get dropped to the end? She would ask a question, give Trump 30s before turning to Biden for a response***To be fair, this was the least biased debate of them all.

He truly seemed committed to addressing ""crime ate change,"" which we can all agree is some progress.***She wasn‚Äôt the bad I also liked her questionsüëçüèΩ you getting thereü§ó***to be honest i think she was the best moderator so far. A few times she gave biden extra responses but she did press him somewhat and the more biden talked the more he screwed up.***She did a lot better than Wallace to be fair. I was expecting her to be worse than she was, although her job was made a lot easier by having the microphones muted.***I mean, she allowed Trump to do the same thing more than a few times. I honestly thought she did a decent job. Some of the questions weren't great, but I honestly expected much worse***She must have worked in a retirement home before.... She was able to wrangle the hell out of both these old bastards.***She was worse than Chris Wallace but no one notices because she didn't visibly panic and try to join the debate like Wallace did. She set things up for Biden repeatedly throughout the debate and hit Trump with unfair leading questions and tried her hardest to make sure he couldn't defend himself. It didn't work of course, I think Trump did a fantastic job and Biden looked like he was panicking and on the backfoot for most of the night, but bottom line Kristen Welker was way worse than Chris Wallace.***For those who aren‚Äôt aware of the rules for tonight‚Äôs debate, each had a guaranteed amount of uninterrupted time, and it was announced in advance that for parts where each candidate interrupted, that would be counted as part of their total time. Trump showed a lot more restraint than the first election, but he at least still interrupted much more than Biden, so the moderator giving more time to Biden was just a consequence, as agreed upon. If anything, the fact that she didn‚Äôt come right out and acknowledge having to cut Trump off because of his interruptions was very fair and professional***She definitely bailed Joe out a few times but I actually think she was actually pretty fair with her moderating.***She was very sly and bailed out Biden from hanging himself when he decided to talk about the Hunter/Laptop/Ukraine. She interrupted him and quickly moved on the discussion before he could say something incriminating.***I actually thought she did a great job and was very neutral and tough. I didn't feel like she favored Biden, or at least it was not obvious to me.***All night she did that nonsense. Kept saying trump had 10 seconds and then they needed to move on were oh so far behind, then she'd let Biden respond yet again and sometimes she wouldn't let trump really talk at all and then would say biden could respond.

I remember one time being when Biden said that dumb Hitler remark... She had just todl Trump they needed to move on or didn't have time or something then biden said that hitler remark and she quietly let him continue it.***Democrats are like people who cheer for the Lakers, Yankees and Patriots.***Debates kinda pointless most voters are decided and this debate didn't swing anyone.***When you single-handedly force the moderators to change the debate rules with your disgraceful performance, you deserve to get put on a leash. 

Still, I think she did a good job... yet Dolan's always the one being unfairly treated. Maybe you guys should retire ""snowflake"" from your list of insults.***To be fair she did quite a good job. The best moderator this year.***She was the best out of the three moderators though.***I want to see a timer to show how long far past their time they went before she interrupted.***I thought she did pretty good. She did give Biden a lot of chances to respond, but I think we only feel that way because Trump would rarely need prompted to respond. I think Trump got the last word in most of the time.  I thought she was pretty fair with her questioning too, actually asking Biden some difficult questions.***No, objectively she was a good moderator***She wasn‚Äôt terrible, did a good enough job. Far better than wallace.***Honestly she was a very good moderator. The criticism beforehand was warranted because of stuff that happened in the past but she showed that she could put her own politics aside.***She would interrupt the president to ask joe if he would like to respond.. It happened at least a half dozen times.. The unwavering and unapologetic non-neutrality is getting reallyyyy old.***I anticipated she would be more biased when I saw she was a transgender woman.***Naw, dude. I was thrilled with how fair she was about letting Trump respond, and at good length, too!***It's not like Trump was giving any actual answers. Even when he finally said he took responsibility for something, he immediately said it was China's fault. 

That's something a child does.

He promised a vaccine was weeks away? He said the kids he tore away from their parents are living well off? People are learning to live with it? 

Where are the real answers?***She did it for Trump too. Even gave him up to 45 seconds after telling him he had 10.

She always said ‚Äúvery quickly‚Äù or ‚Äúyou have 10 seconds‚Äù without regard for which candidate asked.***She‚Äôs a real looker tho.***How come I don‚Äôt see anything about the 545 babies? You conservatives are ridiculous and you‚Äôre grasping at straws‚Äôs. I hope Trump goes to prison***No I thought she was good. People I‚Äôm sure overlooked this but right at the end when Trump was asking if he would destroy the oil industry and he asked ‚Äúwhy would you do that Joe‚Äù?, and the moderator chimed in and said, ‚Äúwhy *would* you do that‚Äù?***Quit complaining, she was actually really good***She did fine. But did she really have to jab Melania in the very beginning with the ‚Äúglad you‚Äôre feeling better‚Äù comment ... fucking eye roll.***LMAOO i thought i was the only one who noticed that, but in all seriousness the first 40 mins She was the BEST!!, maybe after that she realized biden was going down so she thought she‚Äôd favor one side a little bit more

But overall she has been the fairest especially when you compare her to Chris Wallace, anderson cooper and that blonde chick from cnn.***She did pretty good but one thing that bugged me was that After trump asked to be able to make a quick reply to want joe said before he answered the next question. she allowed Biden to make a reply to trumps reply when it was trumps turn.***Do we know she is a dem?***She used way too much self tanning lotion. Either that or her makeup artist chose the wrong color foundation. It doesn't look natural.***Eh. I actually think she did well. She interrupted Trump, but he still got his points across. And she let Joe speak a lot, which was the final nail in the coffin to his campaign. Letting him have that really long awkward pause, asking hard questions that nobody has dared ask their golden boy before. It was annoying, but it was better to let Joe talk more and more.***She was definitely much more subtle.  I liked her and she tried to hide her bias but we all know she favored Biden in this debate.  Every time Trump got Joe shaking, she always said they had to move onto the next topic.***Did anyone else notice how she never interrupted joe but always made an effort to silence trump***As far as libtard moderators go, she was decent lol***She has a stronger chin than me. Fuck she's got a stronger chin than the crimson chin.***Trump worked towards this scenario on purpose, I don't know why you're all complaining again (it's getting typical now, guys). Trump's answers were long rambles that took up a bunch of time to get nowhere. Biden managed to stick to normal debate conventions where you don't constantly take up time with long-winded, repetitive, mostly-hollow statements.

The problem is, the debate moderator has a set amount of time to get through all the questions and answers. If Trump wants to use up as much time as possible to say as little as possible, the moderator is going to have to ask him to shut up and they can move on. And when Biden demands to respond for a few seconds to some dumb thing Trump said, it is the moderator's JOB to enable him to respond.

It's a debate. Not a political rally for two parties at the same time. Y'all are fucked in the head if you think that was a good debate performance by Trump, just because he stopped acting like an insecure little bitch in the last 15 minutes. Did you hear the quiver in his voice during the first question?***Better than the past moderators but still of course defending Joe and letting him off the hook on key points. Anyone else catch when she quickly tried to change subjects when Trump brought up Hunter, fearing he would prob lead into the hard drives? Absolutely shameful***Probably cause joe didn‚Äôt interrupt her every time. She told both they had to move on, only

Not to mention he clearly slurred at some points (I know the man has a stutter), and couldnt find the right word. It happens to people, but jesus it looked terrible when he kept dancing mid sentence for 3-4 seconds looking for the one word.

At one point he gave up and instead of saying ""crimes that <person> was accused of"", he said ""crimes that <person> was suggested""

Bizarre.*** Gotta say that Trump was fantastic tonight. Really showed how quick he is on his feet. Biden had no answer to anything Trump had tonight.

What a line***I was not surprised when Joe forgot north Korean Kim Jung Uns name. The smile on trumps face when that happened. Also i can can tell Joe Biden was  cracking when asked about taking foreign money he couldn't help himself and  said ""here's the deal. "" 

I believe it very un-American to blame Russians for hunter's laptops. Thats the true disinformation campaign going around  and  how he had a line ready regarding how its not about his or trump's family but the families out there. To me  he came off as fake career politician. I would definitely not let Joe run my business. 

My favorite part was when he says he does not see blue or red states. Only the unites states,  and in the next sentence called out on the red states.

Our president,  although not perfect, did way better than I was expecting. I cannot unsee how much he acts like Alec Baldwin now. Its a trip.***What a fucking hail mary he landed there, wanted him to discuss this issue, glad he did*****I look at you....you're a politician....I look at you and you're the reason I ran.  And won.*****I was very disappointed that Trump did not respond by noting that the Democrats not only had control of Congress (both the Senate and the House), but had a fillabuster-proof majority during the first two years of Obama/Biden. They not only could pass whatever they wanted, but did: they passed Obamacare without a single Republican vote.

I wish I could get up there.***Trump got stuff done without Congress majority. Dafuq is Biden talking about.***Biden has been a politician for 47 years and it shows.

He says all of these prescipted phrases that he thinks people are too sheepish to pick up on. He'll blame his inaction on a Republican congress, he'll blame his 8 years on recovering from Bush, he'll say that he can create millions and millions of jobs in clean energy, hell say that he'll make other countries follow international law. (Such an easy follow up, BTW, that she wouldn't ask. How you going to do that Joe, you going to go to war with everyone?)

Joe uses all these unsubstantiated phrases like it's 1971. We're not stupid Joe. We can look things up on the internet. He is a politician to the core and it honestly disgusts me. Worse that that, he tells flatout lies, no problem. 

Love Trump or hate him, he is so starkly contrasted against stereotypical politicians that it really shines on full display when he's up against a typical politician like Biden.***Joe is never specific. ""We're going to fix the economy by fixing the economy"".

He says he's going to get rid of the virus lol. Says he won't shut stuff down then says places need to be shut down or throttled back. 

How can anyone support this clown?***I absolutely love how r/politics thinks Biden won. A CNN poll said that Biden won, and now they think the USA is mostly democrats.

Biden looked real stupid with that silence after saying that.***It's interesting to see two completely different perspectives of the same occurance.***He should have said Dems controlled Congress the first 2 years of the Barry admin.***Y‚Äôall know who is president right now, right?***I don't support Trump and there's a lot of ridiculous and absurd comments down the chain here pretending this was some sort of campaign ender. But all that being said, Trump's response was a good one. Biden runs on being bipartisan and then blamed the other party for all failures during the Obama administration. It's not good optics. And Trump's soft tone in giving Biden advice definitely gives the impression he has wisdom from the job that Biden doesn't have. It was a good moment for Trump.***I'm so fucking pissed they didn't have a segment on Foreign relations or defense.***there's still people that think Biden won***Over on r/politics they literally thought this was a mic drop moment for Biden in the debate thread...***I walked to the kitchen to grab a beer when that happened and it got so quiet I thought my TV lost signal.***This was the funniest part of the debate.  Everyone was expecting Biden to go on after the Republican Congress line and nothing but crickets.  When he said that is it,  i just about died from laughter***the 111th to 113th congress had a democrat controlled senate***Biden: ""*we had a Republican Congress""*

But for two full years you had a Democrat held Congress. Why didn't you do it then?

Just cue the Curb your Enthusiasm music***I mean, it's a fair question obviously but we all know it's a little disingenuous right? the Democrats didn't have the rest of congress. They weren't able to do anything partisan***It's also funny that this was after he said Republican or Democrats it doesn't matter were all Americans.***That was *awful.* Biden lost this election last night.***They had 2 years of a super majority in congress that is extremely rare. There is no excuse for Obama and his administration getting nothing done for 8 years.***This debate had many moments where trump was clearly beating joe Biden but right there was the nail on the coffin. Even dems can‚Äôt say shit***I thought the screen froze after that line about a republican congress... jesus that was actual cringe***I love how Biden makes that face as if he just dropped a huge bombshell comeback.

Put the two of them with Joe Rogan for 3-4 hours and lets get some real answers on their plans, not just them bickering back and forth and blaming each other.***And the moderator quickly jumps to interrupt the president. The media types are more sociopathic than pedophiles***Isn‚Äôt one of Biden‚Äôs arguments on why he should be President based on the premise that ‚Äúrepublican or democrat, we‚Äôll get things done‚Äù? Pretty sure he said something like that.***Well you can‚Äôt negotiate if one side won‚Äôt budge, nor feel they should.***Trump had a perfect retort for that.  Being a president means you have to deal with adversaries and those who on the other side of the aisle.***Biden's debate:

Attacked Trump for negotiating with Kim and helping to make things more stable on the Korean peninsula while he refused to negotiate while in the Whitehouse with Kim and would continue to refuse to do so unless impossible demands that will never be met are met ahead of any negotiations.

Attacked Trump for not acting on the virus while refusing to admit that he called trump xenophobic for acting on the virus.

Attacked Trump for putting children in cages that he actually built. Refused to answer Trump's simple question re same.

Blamed republicans for himself having achieved nothing while in the whitehouse.

Denied saying he would end fracking despite saying he would end fracking.

Russia! Russia! Russia! When asked about laptop.***I know right!! How he he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs China‚Äôs fault‚Äù immediately after taking responsibility, what a cra.... oh wait.***Wait all talk no action? 

So like...Building a wall? Releasing his taxes? Pushing out a vaccine that seems to be ""just a few weeks away"" every month?***Not sure if I‚Äôd call this a winning moment.  McConnell and the GOP controlled senate and house didn‚Äôt allow them to do anything in the last two years of obama‚Äôs presidency.***Joe Biden blaming a Republican Congress is a shitty excuse. But Trump blaming the Democrat congress for COVID relief problems makes perfect sense.***I mean in all fairness, the guy tried to pass things through a majority Republican Congress, especially with gun reforms after the Sandyhook shooting, but majority of Republicans in congress voted against them. In all honesty, thats why Obama and Joe haven‚Äôt been able to pass much, thats why even Trump can‚Äôt get certain things passed either.***u/savethisvideo***up votes jumping up and down a lot on this one***No matter what anyone here says, Trump has worked his ass off and accomplished more things than most presidents.  If everyone would work together America would be amazing.

Biden hasnt done anything in 47 years...***Wait, I‚Äôm confused. All the liberal subs are making memes about how Biden owned Trump with this. He‚Äôs saying we couldn‚Äôt get any of that done because we had a republican Congress, as in the Republicans were keeping us from doing anything effective. How is this a winning moment for trump?***Why was the moderator so eager to move on?***Why is that not the answer? The GOP was openly very set on obstructing the Obama admin from doing anything, but now afterwards we're going to criticize them for not doing enough?***I literally laughed my ass off when this happened***The Republican Senate was fully obstructionist under Obama.  Even McConnell bragged about how much legislation he shot down in the upper house.  It's why everything Obama did was by executive order.

I'm not saying the Senate was right or wrong to do so.  But it does explain why the last administration wasnt able to get anything done.  I really dont see how this was a winning point?***I was glad that Trump called him out on this shit. This is why I‚Äôm so cynical about politics when I started following it more closely. All these politicians like to blame the other party and like Joe, have been in office for a long time. They make all these promises about reform but then it‚Äôs like, no one calls them out for failing to do it before. Trump did just that and it‚Äôs truly refreshing. All of this shit is all talk until it‚Äôs done.***The same thing happens when it's a republican congress as when it's a democrat congress. Go figure!***\#Winning!***Mind boggling that both r/conservative and r/liberal thing that this was a great moment for them. 

How?  Obama/Biden actually did enact things (gay marriage, Obamacare, DREAMERS, expanded student protections, etc).  they also didn't enact a lot of things (SC nominee)  Republicans did obstruct a lot.  Mitch said the number one goal was to make Obama a one term president.  They also tried what?  40+ times to repeal Obamacare?


Likewise, Trump can't even pass this most recent stimulus bill.  The ""wall"" has been mostly repairs.  He has, however, applied tariffs and changed some trade agreements, etc.  So again, a mixed bag.

Point being, our government system has built in checks and balances so any change is slow.  Doesn't matter who it is.  Which is a good thing.


The meme and entertainment obsessed mindset I'm seeing gives me very little faith we have adults making decisions at this point.***Trump already did the heavy lifting on the virus - warp speed vaccine development with multiple projects, massive vaccine manufacturing already in progress, ramping up capacity for treatment, 85% reduction in mortality with improved therapeutics. 

Red states promised pensions to the public service unions but never funded it.  Just like the auto manufactures we bailed out in 2008. 

They will come crying hat in hand like irresponsible children.  If Biden doesn't win they will be short 10s of trillions of $***They literally were 3 seats in the senate away from total control of Congress. If they can‚Äôt convince 3 people to cross the aisle it‚Äôs a bad bill done you think üòÖ***‚ÄúI reached across the isle and got things done, what did you do joe? Nothing‚Äù***I thought the moderator was great***I love how Donald is looking over at Joe during the silence.***That cold ass stare Trump gave him was the best part. I could feel it.***Trump crushed it this time around, Biden was derailed the entire second half... That absolutely absurd comment about phasing out oil lmao.  Biden handled this debate rather poorly, but fuck up Joe.  Thank you***The pregnant pause there was glorious.  Just let the stupidity of the moment hang in the air.***Come on man!!!!***As an independent, I came into this debate curious to hear both sides. I wanted to hear policy. 

Biden spoke policy. Trump didn't. Then I went and fact checked what I could. Biden had some lies, but mostly truths. Trump had mostly lies and exaggerated truths. 

I find it odd that, any affiliated group will put the blame on whatever party has control in the next step of the executive process. Regardless of the level of organization, it looks like it always turns into a stalement. While you all are chuckling at this, it's reasonable for Biden to say that. Because in the same sense, Why haven't we gotten another stimulus bill? Well two divided portions of government can't come to an agreement. And two divided people are putting the blame on either side. 

Biden saying this, is the same as Trump saying the reason we haven't passed an additional stimulus bill is because of the Democratic House majority. Also I'm willing to bet many here would consider that a mic drop response. 

This shouldn't be a popularity contest, it should be about what policy will be the most beneficial to this country. At the moment everything I've read has showed Biden's policy (if true) to be the most beneficial for the country.

Feel free to put information you deem to be correct, I'm genuinely curious about the logic behind Trump's support.  Also I prefer sources to your rhetoric.***Fox didn‚Äôt show both candidates on split screen the whole time? That‚Äôs weird. What are they hiding?***someone needs to fire the camera man on this video.***One thing I wish Trump would have confronted Biden on is; if Joe thought/thinks the ACA was/is so great, why is he so bent on replacing it with ‚ÄúBiden Care‚Äù. He talks about lowering premiums, lowering drug prices, making it affordable, keeping your private insurance, all of which was the whole point of Obamacare. When in fact premiums have doubled, if not tripled, thousands have lost their private insurance and team Trump are the ones that lowered prescription prices. When Biden says his plan will offer lower costs, lower premiums, promises of keeping private insurance, he‚Äôs essentially admitting that Obamacare/ACA is terrible yet he praises it. I‚Äôm confused why he praises it if he wants to replace it and I wish Trump would have called him out on it.***I was laughing so hard at the dead silence after he said that I totally missed Trump saying ""You gotta talk them into it, Joe.""

#C'MON***72 Days, that's the amount of time they had an actual super majority that let them pass something.

After that Republicans filibustered everything.

It also doesn't look good when Trump literally complained a few questions earlier that he couldn't get something done because the Democrats.***F***is there anywhere were we can see the expression of the moderator ?***And the ""PoLlS"" would still say Biden won the debate***Trump is such a hero***I mean great answer Joe. So you were hired for a job, that you refused to do because you had to work with people you disagree with. Imagine anyone else in the country doing that for 8 years. Trump's joke doesn't even sell how pathetic of a rebuttal that was...***Literally just got to this moment. God the cringe in the room.***BWAHAHAHAHAHA!***the silence was epic.***That pregnant pause tho...***Got em.***Did anyone catch that he referred to the 80‚Äôs for the 1994 crime bill?***Trump should have added that the Dems had a supermajority for the first 2 years.  That means no filibusters in the Senate.  That means total control of the Congress.  You can literally do anything, including packing the courts.  And they squandered it on Obamacare that still managed to just barely pass.***I laughed out loud at the loooooooong silence after he said that.***Imagine if the first debate had gone like this one...trump definitely won this one***When the dementia kicks in***God that was sooo good to watch, Trump KILLED him!***Biden just kept saying slogans and talking about breakfast tables.

He got mowed down.***I guffawed when he spouted the 'republican congress' line. Tells you everything you need to know about lack of leadership qualities from the White House for that 8 year period. They lost both the house and senate and then got jack shit done because they were unable to bring the parties together.

It's also the reason essentially all of Obama's accomplishments have been unraveled because he had to resort to executive orders and their ilk to get anything done. Biden is more concerned about his own families status than the American people.

One addition upon further reflection: Biden's excuse for why he couldn't get anything done illuminates perhaps the biggest difference between Trump and Biden. And that is Trump's tenacity, a willingness to get things done and see things through to the end. You look at how the deck has been stacked against Trump this 4 years with the impeachment trial, Russia collusion narrative, insiders working against him, establishment media and Hollywood working against him 100% of the time....and look at what he's accomplished despite that. Major trade deals, major peace deals, criminal justice reform, hundreds of lower court judges and 3 supreme court judges confirmed (almost), hard negotiations with allies to pay more for defense, hundreds of miles of border barrier erected when congress wouldn't give him a dime and he found a way to get it done anyway, all while dealing with Covid in 2020. By and large he's doing what he said he would. I believed him when he said that in 2015/2016 when he made those promises and I believe him now.***Its funny because congress was a Democrat majority... so nice try Joe***You know Trump is president right now, right? Where is his healthcare plan? He's been promising it for 4 years.***C'mon guys. Donald trump is using the same excuse for why he cant get a stimulus bill done. But uses it against Biden like it was his responsibility to force us to be talked into the stimulus bill. Cant have it both ways... Downvote me if you want but Trump cant get a stimulus bill done because of the democrats right now...why isn't he using his ""Leadership""?

This isn't winning the debate...this is slight hypocrisy...whether its a popular opinion here or not.******Trump's been President for four years with GOP control of the Senate and he's done nothing. Watched +200,000 Americans die while he talks about eliminating ACA with no actual health plan to replace it. He speaks of everything like it's always two weeks away yet he's been President for four years and hasn't even developed his ""plan"" yet.

The Mute function really helped Trump this time compared to the cluster fuck of the first debate and it backfired against Biden, And for whatever reason Biden just seemed to start falling apart about midway through rather it be the Coffee wearing off or whatever it was.

Again, the best thing Trump did effectively is hitting Biden on some issues.    He turned the kids on the border comments back on the Biden/Obama administration whom created the original policy of child separation.  He raised Biden's crime bill from 1994 and hinted at Biden's racism, talked at length about the Biden family corruption, which will get a lot more attention.

That sub is a mental asylum***Biden really screwed himself with small business owners tonight   Aside from more handouts he has no plans for them. That idiot as president would advocate for more lockdowns***Anyone else see Biden put his mask on at the end and then kiss his wife both with their masks on?  Lol the pandering.***I was going to vote for libertarian. Trump convinced me otherwise. That was structured, deliberate, and sound man on stage. Not what I expected. Kudos to you Donald.

Edit:  What a good day for my cake day.***All the libs in r/politics coping and saying Biden won lol***Dana Perino is looking especially good tonight****THUG****This livestream with undecided voters is totally backfiring on the LA Times: https://youtu.be/Xie2wCbrxGY.***I‚Äôm still laughing at this exchange:
Trump:$28 million dollars to farmers.
Biden: Taxpayer money
Trump:I‚Äôm sorry
Biden: Taxpayer money
Trump:The taxpayer is CHINA***Biden locked himself in his house all week for THAT?***My favorite quote from Joe is, "" I don't look at them as blue or red states ! I look at them as a country! But the red states are the ones seeing an uptick in cases !!!"" Lmfao***Moderator did a great job. Good debate.***WHO BUILT THE CAGES JOE?  Make a shirt of it - I'll wear it for the next two weeks.***It was a Republican Congress.

Fact check:FALSE***Oddly enough, there was a fair amount of foreign policy discussion. I was truly and pleasantly surprised the moderator let that happen.  I wonder if she'll still be with CBS in the morning.***Funny how all the polls come out with Biden as the winner. I mean I didn‚Äôt expect much. Polls are garbage as will be confirmed on November 3rd.***Chris Wallace‚Äôs first comment after the debate was that he was jealous and wished he could have had the same debate. You could have had that type of debate if you didn‚Äôt suck so bad, Chris.***A buddy of mine is currently wasted for every time Biden said that ""Trump has no plan"" or something of those lines***Get ready for the media blitz on covid cases...***Best quote for me ‚Äúwe had a good relationship with hitler before he invaded Europe‚Äù. Like what even...?***CNN just polled 11 ‚Äúrandom‚Äù people about who won. 9 said Biden, 2 said draw, 0 said trump. What the hell? Did we watch the same debate?***So excited to vote for Trump.***It seems like Biden spent a lot of time on the defensive in dismissive laugh mode. Trump scored some real points on corruption and Biden had no answers.******Who built the cages, joe?***Who built the cages joe?!***Trump just won a 2nd Term!  

Best debate he's ever had.  He won the debate 65 - 35 by my score and any undecided who watched this, and those are the people who decide elections will break for him.  He won on Covid (a weak spot), he crushed Biden on the Economy, and he nailed Biden on the Biden Crime Family Corruption scandal.***Moderator did well.  Will enjoy seeing both sides label their own as the winner but at the end of the day not many minds will be changed.  Except for Joe's oil industry comment.  Of all the things, that'll move percent points in very important states in Trump's favor.

Just that one question has made this race much closer for Trump.***Trump did an awesome job. Hispanics for Trump. I am at -100 in 2 mins for posting that Trump won in r/politics. Imagine when Trump wins again. They are going to explode.***Also Biden mentioned the ""Poor Boys""

Never heard of them ü§£***So much more enjoyable then the previous debate. Props to the moderator for keeping things on track.***I‚Äôve heard from multiple MAGA friends that watched it tonight (I couldn‚Äôt, was busy). They said Trump slayed him. So now I can‚Äôt wait to see the leftist mental gymnastics trying to tell us how Biden won it.***ok why is nobody talking about how Trump‚Äôs mic cut out multiple times, and Biden‚Äôs was never turned off***Wish he pushed the tax raises***What a huge win for Trump tonight. Absolutely laid it on Biden and won BIG.***I really like how the media is portraying Trump as an ""outsider with results""

And Trump himself distanced himself from the typical political class and made fun of them at the same time.***Whew he said Abraham Lincoln was the most racist president lmfao***PA and Texas for sure staying red after this one. Trump baited Biden hard on the end bringing up oil, and Biden fell for it.***Trump easily beat Biden. Fuck chris Wallace***Measured, let Biden fumble and be on his heels all night. Trump was on measured attack all night and Biden has no stamina clearly. He was very clearly frustrated and that translated in camera. I honestly thought the moderator was excellent and that‚Äôs not only a relief for the result and watch ability of the debate, but changes the outbound barricade from ‚Äúthe media hates‚Äù us which I think there is a bit of fatigue for. 

Overall massive win for Trump, will it move the needle? Tough to say but it is absolutely a positive and potentially will bring results in PA/OH which is obviously massive.***Trump haters who can‚Äôt deny that Trump did well are saying ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter, debates don‚Äôt change any minds.‚Äù What‚Äôs the point of having a debate then?***My favorite Trump line: After Biden saying he had a Republican congress there was a painful pause.  ""*Well.... ya gotta talk 'em into it Joe*""***Moderator was substantially better than Chris Wallace, while the topics were trash the questions were more even. Critiques:

- She gave Biden the last word nearly every topic, and on the few times Trump got the last word she literally tried to fact check him in real time.
- She spoke over Trump numerous times, and didn't interrupt Biden once. She literally spoke over Trump for a good 15 seconds, and then said ""Biden your response"". And then was silent while he spoke for 30 seconds.

I think both candidates did okay. I think Trump won in the end due to expectations. This was a complete reversal from the first debate. Trump needed to screw this bad and Biden needed to knock it out of the park. I think Biden will continue to bleed in the polls all the way to election.***Shout out to the dude in the thread who actively used BadCopNoDonut and Politics who argued with me about median income being a bad measurement because it was so much higher than average income but failed to realize that he was looking at household income and then deleted his comments when he found that out.***When Joe says that foreign countries will have to pay a price for interfering in our election, the world knows he‚Äôs talking about payments to Hunter***""I'm not going to ban fracking"" *whew!*ü•≥

""We're going to eliminate franking over time"" *...wait, wut?* üò®***Trump did well tonight. 

Who am I kidding, Trump won Pennsylvania tonight.***Van Jones is having a meltdown***Trump kicked his ass. Biden made a huge mistake talking about banning oil.***The moderator for this debate was actually good

Unlike Chris Wallace***It was the equivalent of Mike Tyson and Woody Allen in a boxing match.***Only thing I wish is when Biden said that all the police officers are losing their jobs because of the lack of relief bill I wish trump corrected him and said it was because his party was defunding them***Best moment in the debate was when the moderator said in an exasperated tone: ‚ÄúWhy would you do that.‚Äù That was a crazy own goal for Biden***I want to say that I love how Trump called Biden ‚Äúthe big man‚Äù tonight. He definitely needs to push more on that***Thought POTUS performed very well. Getting Joe to say he‚Äôs going to end the oil industry was brilliant. Biden seemed incoherent at points, and kept changing the subject. Think tonight was a very good night for Donald Trump and the USA***Kristen Welker was fire!!! She blew it out of the water. Was expecting a clone of Wallace, even Trump complimented her. Great job!***Impressive, even CNN is calling out Biden on Fracking and Oil***Trump just won this election. The dems are left with their pants down and terminally delusional. I cannot wait for the tears again. 2016 all over again.***r/politics got mad at me üòî üòî


https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jgec4y/discussion_thread_final_presidential_debate/g9pxfyj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3***Trump has a surprisingly good sense of humour, and the jokes come out when you least expect it. Biden was prepared but very dry!

Sometimes, it's the little things (like humour) that make a huge difference...

Especially liked the moment when Trump mocked Biden for looking and speaking straight at the Camera, to the people sitting at home around the dinner table ü§£***Moderator done a great job***I think this debate(I ended up watching) showed that when the moderator isn't 100% against him Trump can do well.

Hats off to the moderator, good job imo.***Biden buried himself with his plans for the oil industry. Americans are listening! Trump 2020***I just shake my head on Biden being the Democrats' BEST choice. That's just more fucked up than Joe and Hunter's mental states...combined.

Do Democrats literally try to find the worst possible candidates?

Was 2016 not a clue?***Watched a bit of CNN after the debate. They had the odasity to say that allegations against Biden are disgusting and dangerous meanwhile they promoted the fake Russia narrative for 3 years. Garbage outlet***Trump hit it out of the park with the whole Hunter Biden stuff as well as 47 years in government***Only reason Biden seems like he did ok was because he lied out of his ass. And it‚Äôs funny how he tried to plead against minimum sentencing when he literally made it***Trump just put Joe in a home***so far the only post on insta stories was ‚Äútrump said he was the least racist person ever‚Äù***Has CNN said Biden won yet?***I was talking to a family member after the debate and they said Trump was really good on policy but they think he will lose because of his personality and they said he's not likable? I tried to tell him about everything he has done on policy and that he's not a politician but he said most of the country votes on who they deem to be like-able

&#x200B;

I don't know about you guys but Biden isn't the most likable guy when he says things like the voters don't deserve to know where he stands on issues and he constantly changes his policy positions***I‚Äôll admit my mindset about debates has always been that they don‚Äôt really change the minds of voters, especially this year. I think most people have made their mind up a long time ago on who they are voting for on November 3rd.

However there‚Äôs just no way that Biden‚Äôs comments on oil and immigration didn‚Äôt change some people‚Äôs minds. If you‚Äôre a fair minded democrat In Pennsylvania could you really vote for the guy that just admitted he wants to end one of your biggest industries. Same goes for any person in an oil dependent state.***Some of us can make the argument that Trump lost the first debate.

But he clearly won that one.***Best performance by Trump

Biden continues to look old and frail.***Am I the only one expecting the Biden campaign to come out with ""alternate facts"" on what Joe said, in vain hopes to not alienate his base?

""He said \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but what he actually meant was \_\_\_\_\_\_!  Listen.  Here's the deal.  Just don't listen to what anyone else says.  Yes, including Joe himself.  It's just a debate!""***I'm gonna be honest. The muting definitely backfired for the left lol***If every American watched that debate it would be a landslide for Trump.***Trump did a hell of a job tonight. I think if I truly were an independent coming away from watching that, I would vote Trump. He just seemed so much better and improved from the prior debate, while Biden was lacking. Then again that may be my bias.***i‚Äôll be updating y‚Äôall tomorrow what the teen girl sjw post on their insta stories***The Ukraine confrontation and oil industry plans were a big loss I feel for Biden. Life is good under Trump. I don't think Biden's radical changes from that comfort is appealing to Americans***My biggest takeaway: It's a shame that the left hates Trump largely without reason. He's likely going to be the most entertaining president in all of our lifetimes.***Just permanently banned from white people twitter for the following comment:

A) there was a democratic congress from 2009-2011, both houses. He is a liar.

B) Trump's First Step Act was bipartisan

C) Biden was in the Senate for over 20 years of democratic majorities, what was passed then? Other than the 1994 crime bill, of course?

Main point: Trump had both houses during first two years and got something done. Biden had both houses during first two years and did not.

Hasan is a dumbass***Over whelming majority of what Biden said tonight was attacking Trump rather than talking what he is going to do. And sadly it may just work for him. Democrats in 2020 are running more on an anti Trump agenda than a pro Biden agenda so attacking Trump is more their speed***‚ÄúBash: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Just to clarify, would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?
Biden:¬†No, we would ‚Äî we would work it out. We would make sure it‚Äôs eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either ‚Äî any fossil fuel.‚Äù***Boe Jiden malfunctioned a couple of times there eh? Even pulled out an old H W watch check on us!***Trump: ‚ÄúLaptop‚Äù

Biden: ‚ÄúOh, God!‚Äù

EVERYBODY DRINK***The comments on r/politics are absurd. People are brainwashed like it‚Äôs actually scary.***LMAO CNN fake news ""undecided panel"" had 0 saying Trump won, 9 said Biden won. That literally can't even be believable to their base, can it? I mean c'mon man***Biden spent the entire debate tripping over his words and contradicting himself(poor boys stand by and stand ready lmao)

It's also pretty hilarious that he managed take such a minor topic such as climate change and shoot himself in the foot over it.***Wish no new wars was mentioned***Anyone else catch Biden throw Obama under the bus lol. Obama was prolly on his couch like ‚ÄúWtf bro I‚Äôm out here campaigning for you.‚Äù***My favorite line was Biden capping off the debate by saying we need ""hope over fear"".  

I too am hopeful for the coming ""dark winter"".  That'll be so much better then the scary ""recovery"" Trump's predicting.***God damn watched the second half, Trump rocked that shit. Very happy with his performance.***Had to pause it and am now catching up. The race issue was a total Trump win. Biden has nothing but empty accusations of ""racist"".***Trump did very well. He didn't do anything to turn women off, which he needs to win this.***Well done, Kristen Welker.***Props to the moderator for being fair tho.

Trump 2020***CNN ""trump lies""***This is the Donald Trump I voted for. Focused strategic in how he speaks he acted as if he wanted to say something a lot of times but stopped himself this was the real Donald Trump. Also great moderator.***Gotta love how the moderator was able to fit in the ""breaking news from last night"" bs about Iran and Russia pretending to be Trump voters, but couldn't find the time to ask Joe Biden a single question about the laptop allegations.***R/politics is saying Biden won and oddly enough saying how ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù he is.  Not sure I‚Äôd use that word to describe Biden.  Do they just see what they want to see?***Not one question on Afghanistan is a joke. Our longest war in history and it can‚Äôt even get a mention.***10-20% of Independents usually don't know how they're voting until the 2nd debate according to past polls. This year Independents are supposed to make up a larger plurality of voters. So far only about 15% of early voters have been independent. 

Trump did everything he could to appeal to moderates and undecided. He talked about policy when appropriate and made excellent points about Biden's financial situation. Everyone already knows Trump is rich. Going after Trump's wealth is just dumb unless you find actual laws being broken***MAN!!! I am still fired up. Trump killed that debate. He blatantly reveled Biden‚Äôs constant lies and plans to destroy this economy with Biden stumbling and... was that a glitch? This is the best I have ever felt about Trumps reelection baby lets go... Donald Pump Trump 2020!!!!!***Are ratings out yet? I hope more people watched this debate than the last***I didn‚Äôt watch the debates last night. So i wanted to see how they went. /r/politics was literally just a Biden highlight reel with literally nothing bad biden did during the debate. Then i went to /r/conservative after and the videos i saw here looked like biden really shit the bed. ‚ÄúRepublican Congress‚Äù -Joe Biden. Wasn‚Äôt even mentioned on there***When Biden was pretending to be emotional over the kids separated from their families he said ‚Äúthousands of kids with no one...‚Äù and in my head it auto completed ‚Äú...to sniff them‚Äù***Biden seemed to get angry for no real reason about halfway through and stayed like that until the end. He was even yelling at the moderator who was lobbing him softballs. Maybe the medicine was starting to wear off?***They‚Äôve been doing the drip, drip, drip with those emails. Something will come out in the next few days that totally contradicts what Biden said and make him look like (more of) an asshole.***Good job by all involved.  A successful debate!***If you're an undecided voter, how do you not vote for Trump after that?***Trump did well, but he'll really land the hits tomorrow with Biden making a colossally idiotic comment at the end saying he wants to get rid of oil.   That is an instant ad.***I'm sorry everyone is wrong about the moderator.   


She kept challenging Trump all night and kept interrupting him.***I just saw the [video](https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/jgh3rz/la_times_post_debate_focus_group_says_they_will/) of the The LA Times debate focus group and 12 of the 13 participants said if the election was held today they‚Äôd vote for Trump.

That should be the clip lol.***I know Biden was joking, but Trump just needs to do what the Dems do and run that quote without context lol. 

‚ÄúBiden calls Abraham Lincoln a racist‚Äù***It was pretty clear he was saying that sarcastically...***Not a biden fan... 

But...  

This clip is extremely out of context, he was referring to Trump"" as Abraham Lincoln, not Abraham Lincoln himself. The reason he referred to Trump as this is because Trump said, paraphrase: ""I'm the least racist president president in the history of the u ited states, second to maybe Abraham Lincoln."" 

Again not a biden fan, but let's not be like the libs and take everything out of context.***It was sarcastic. Idk if the post is attempting to convey otherwise but it certainly feels like it. Of all of the Biden gaffs in that, you chose the one that wasn‚Äôt even a misspeak?***I get that everyone here is saying that‚Äôs a gaff and it is. Honestly though it was a poor attempt at ironically calling out Trump for comparing himself to Abe. Obviously didn‚Äôt translate well when it came out of his mouth***Not a fan of Biden but this is just the same as Trump calling Warren ‚ÄúPocahontas‚Äù. A way of mocking someone‚Äôs claims about themselves.***Well lets be fair here, he was trying to make a dig at Trump based on what Trump said about being the best thing to happen to black people since Abraham Lincoln.  This quote from Biden came shortly after that comment from Trump.  It was a flop of a joke, but he was trying to make a dig at Trump for Trump comparing himself to Abraham Lincoln.  I mean I don't think we need to misrepresent the intent to point out what a flawed comment it was.    


People pretending that he was saying that Abraham Lincoln was racist are either being disingenuous or are ignoring the context...lets be serious here.***We all know he was referring to Trump comparing himself to Lincoln 2 minutes earlier. It's a funny soundbite but there's context to anyone who actually watched the debate. Focus on the actual mistakes he made, like pretending no one lost their health plan.***Called Honest Abe a racist, told America to check the tape because he never said he'd ban fracking, and ""why would you do that?""

Otherwise went really well for Joe.***Biden has been in office so long and he‚Äôs so cognitively challenged, he might have actually thought he was debating Lincoln at that moment.***Please don‚Äôt start doing the same shit as the liberal media and take stuff out of context. Be better than them please. It makes us look bad. You know damn well he wasn‚Äôt actually talking about Lincoln. For those that didn‚Äôt watch or aren‚Äôt bright enough to hear it from this clip; Joe was referring to Trump in a sarcastic manor by calling him ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù.***""here"" indicates he's sarcastically referring to Trump, most likely.***It was obviously a joke about how Trump was comparing himself to Abraham Lincoln. I'm not a Biden guy but come on man, this borders on fake news.***This seems like its most likely just a joke making fun of trump comparing himself to abe tbh***Imagine taking this out of context***I got what he was trying to do.

But Trump never said he was Lincoln, he never said he was *like* Lincoln, either.

Whether Joe wants to admit it or not, it makes you question whether he's following what's going on.***Remember when calling someone a racist was fighting words? When it actually meant something? I sure do.***I thought we understood sarcasm in this sub***Dog whistle for BLM to topple more statues of Lincoln.***It was literally a joke. Trump claimed to have done more than Abe lincoln for the black community***lol what a doofus. This idiot Biden called trump honest Abe. Burn !!! Joe!!!***It's surprising that you are unable to recognise a joke when you've been supporting one for the past 4 years***u/SaveThisVideo***It was obvious he was mocking Trump. You're all captured partisan hacks***So many morons here actually think Biden wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic lol***Never pour fuel on a fracist fire***I've got hairy legs!***He mocked Trump by calling him Lincoln since he thinks he's done more than black Americans than anyone since him. How are you guys not getting that?***‚ÄúI have no argument so...he be racist‚Äù***Joe ""Republican

Gotta distract from his never ending lie-a-tribe against Donny.***Take away: Abraham Lincoln is the most racist President in history... Got it, thanks Joe.***Jesus, you guys realize he was mocking him right?  Calling him Lincoln was a joke..***My family is so far left that one just went pass them.***Oh come on, Joe! If it‚Äôs so obvious that he‚Äôs pouring fuel over every single racist fire, why can you not provide an example of him doing so?? Come on, man!***He was joking/sarcasm, but his joke was based off something Trump didn't say.***I thought this was kind of funny, trump was saying ""besides probably lincoln I've done more for black people than any president ever."" and then joe biden said this.

still voting trump, but this was a funny comeback in my opinion.***u/savethisvideo***It‚Äôs called being facetious guys. Sarcasm is never heard by the less intelligent.***That didn't turn out too well.

I mean, if said right you can tell he was trying to make a quip or joke about Trump referring himself to being as great as Abe, but telling jokes isn't his strong point lol. Now Biden and the radical left politicians can see how it feels getting their joke twisted out of context and ridiculed/attacked for it, just like they do to Trump at every chance they can get. 

100% Karma IMO.***the most important thing about comedy is the

...


timing***He meant it sarcastically but given that Biden is very clearly suffering from what seems like dementia, I can see why people might believe he thought he was actually debating a man who has been dead for over 100 years.***Happy Cake Day***Establishing the 13th amendment was pouring fuel on the racist fire.***Pretty sure he was mocking Trump's anti-racism statements by referring to him as Abraham Lincoln.

Whether you're conservative or not, you should always get all of the facts.***u/savethisvideo***Is he calling Trump, Abraham Lincoln?***Lincoln actually was racist though. He opened his Debate with Steven Douglas by saying:

>‚ÄúI am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and Black races. ... There is a physical difference between the white and Black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.‚Äù

He was just against slavery. So, in the context of the time, less racist than average for back then, but still racist by any standard.***So while I am a Trump supporter, we owe it to democracy to at least provide full context and not distort the ttruth.

I am pretty sure he's mocking Trump by referring to him as ""Abraham Lincoln"". You can hear him say ""Abraham Lincoln here..."", which I would wager he's saying because of Trump's saying he's done more for Black Americans than any president except Abraham Lincoln.***wow i laughed out loud in my office just now.***HEY JOE COME ON MAN

TRUMP GOT UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS DOWN TO ITS LOWEST

THATS CARING ABOUT ALL OF AMERICA 

U LIBERAL ELITIST HYPOCRITE***So you're ignoring the fact that he's mockingly calling Trump ""Abraham Lincoln"" and instead sit inside your jerk-off kingdom hoping to whack one out over a poorly cut video while your Mee-Maw looses a leg to Diabeetus and your son is shipped off to fight a war in a country that you can't locate on a map. 

Until they've taken everything you have, you will never be satisfied. You have the right to a good country that takes care of you. Don't forget that Americans. That's why you fight and die in those wars. So the government will pick up the tab in times of crisis. 

But yeah, Fuck Biden! Lock her up! Who built the cages! Superman!***I'm not gonna lie, I'm a conservative but if Biden had delivered this joke a little better, it would have actually been kinda funny. But that's more of a Trump joke and Biden isn't good at that.***He ain‚Äôt wrong.

Somethings are beyond saving***This was taken out of context. Trump proclaimed himself to be the modern day Lincoln and Biden made a joke about it.***Sometimes the ads just write themselves***What I find disgusting is Biden blaming Trump for the deaths from Covid 19. Biden‚Äôs big lie never blaming the CCP for the deaths worldwide. Come on, man, the Communist Chinese will never b blamed for the global pandemic by Biden & the democrats.***Watch the full clip, dammit***That was truly a surreal moment.***Wut***Lol saying that he was ‚Äòthe least racist person in the room‚Äô to a black debate moderator was pretty awkward to me.***Not to be a downer but Lincoln did sign the order to execute over 300 native Americans in the Dakota uprising in Minnesota. Mass hangings too, like was that totally necessary...***didn't he end slavery WTF  
literally rewriting history***I know where is Joe is coming from. It took a lot of persuasion to turn the civil war from what it was to what it became... freeing the black person. But common maaaaan. He still did it with the intention of freeing them. Maybe not in the beginning but that turned to the end goal like are you dumb? I'm Canadian and even I know that.***I think he was referring to Trump as Lincoln here. Dont know how that was gonna help his point, especially when his dementia started kicking in.***Now it‚Äôs pretty clear Biden is trying to call trump a nickname like trump does with ‚Äúsleepy joe‚Äù or ‚ÄúPocahontas‚Äù but Abraham Lincoln as insulting name come on sleepy joe***Please tell me that was in the most recent debate.***What made this funny was earlier in the debate Sleepy Joe claimed Trump didn't know who he was debating.***This clip is proof that democrats don't bother doing any research for themselves and take their leaders' words as gospel. You could soend about 2 minutes on any search engine and find loads of evidence that Trump has done more for the betterment of minorities and minority communities in American than any president in decades.***Lmao Biden kept saying Trump forgot who he's running against... Well Biden seemed to confuse Trump with a president who served back in the 1860s üòÜ***He was being sarcastic because Trump said he was the least racist president since Lincoln. He was being sarcastic***Grandpa Biden was trying to make a nickname joke like Trump does, but it wasn't good.

Putting all those black folks out of jobs, damnit! What racist policies!!!***This was a big wtf moment for me.***Dude's Adderall was wearing off. He's building a tolerance.***If you're going to use the  sarcasm card when trump says something stupid but forget what it is when Biden says something, don't use it at all.***Oh yeah, because the left doesn't inflame racism at all. God, I hate it when the left accuses the right of being racist without a single ounce of self-awareness. It is nothing but pure projection.

- Blaming white people for the evils of the world and telling them they have white privilege. This is just white supremacy with a guilty conscience.

- Their perpetual victimhood and the bigotry of low expectations. You don't think telling minorities that the system will always be stacked against them because of their race is pouring fuel on the fires of racism?

- Segregating campuses and other leftist spaces, California actually attempting to repeal Civil Rights legislature this election. Surely this won't lead to any negative consequences...

- Inciting the oppression Olympics with intersectionality, affirmative action that sows racial distrust among colleagues. 

- Constantly talking about race when no one wants to hear it. Claiming everything is racist, and even looking for racism when it doesn't exist, you don't think that *inventing racism* is pouring fuel on racist fires?

The scholar Kimberl√© Crenshaw, who is one of the mothers of modern critical race theory, specifically says the purpose of the ideology is to ""raise race consciousness"" in our society. That is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. 

I don't doubt there are problems with racism on the right, but kindly fuck off Joe - you don't have the track record to afford pointing fingers and accusing others of racism.

Every single one.""***This is the mini-essay I wrote in one day for a school assignment telling why I (14M) would vote for Trump if I could vote in this election. It's not perfect, I know, but it's the best I could do in 4 hours or so:

&#x200B;

If I could vote in this election, I would vote for Donald Trump. I would vote for him because of how he has helped the economy, kept the nation safe from outside forces, and helped the environment.

After doing some research, I found that his administration created the W-GDP initiative to help women participate in the economy. I also found out that the African, Latino, and Asian American unemployment rates reached all-time lows under his administration. This shows that he truly supports minorities and women, contrary to what many people think and say about him.

Also, Donald Trump has focused on protecting our nation. He signed a $700 billion NDAA to rebuild our military, which also gave the military a 2.4% pay raise. He also became the first sitting US president to enter North Korea and start discussing denuclearization with the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.

Finally, Trump has helped make environmental regulations more affordable. For example, he revoked President Obama‚Äôs costly Clean Power Plan and replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy Rule. He also created a Superfund task force to streamline the hazardous waste clean up that the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (aka Superfund) performs. 

In conclusion, I would vote for Donald Trump if I could vote in this election. What the sitting President has done for the economy, the security of the nation, and the cleaning up of the environment has further supported that opinion.***Had to be worst possible president to switch the names round***I know Trump is trying to win more of the black vote but running to the left of Biden on criminal justice is super confusing.

Also, Trump's deregulations did not result in an increase of pollution. The numbers have actually been steadily going down during his administration.

 The vast majority of contaminated sites were caused by activities decades ago. I've never worked at a site where it was recent, and I've been doing this for over a decade.  Industry/companies these days are actually very responsible, in part because epa and state environmental agencies are up their asses.

Secondly, the nature of war has changed. Bush, Obama and Trump all increasingly engaged in drone warfare. Trump allowed 2,243 drone strikes in his first two years in comparison to Obama‚Äôs 1878 strikes over 8 years. (Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47480207)

If you're clinging on to Trump's ""who built the cages?"" questions as some sort of victory, then you're letting all of America down by turning a blind eye to the real crime here. It's time some of you remember what it means to be an American, and what this country is supposed to stand for. Or you may as well put a big ""made in China"" sticker over the entire country, because we Americans are starting to take horrible practices right out of China's playbook.***Why are people even being detained at all?

If we see them show up illegally, why not just deny access / send them back? What‚Äôs the detainment about?***Who filled them?***They were used as 72 hour holding centers under Obama, before the migrants were transferred to Health and Human Services.

Obama built the cages, as temporary housing blocks and under that law they were in them for less than 72 hours, and were for unaccompanied children only. They had the fencing to divide the kids by age group, gender, and nationality - since it made sense to keep people from Guatamala together or Nicaragua. 


Under this administration, they are used to actually intentionally separate children from their parents, and are massively over crowded and many sleep on the floor and lack basic needs. Meanwhile Trump deflects and says he inherited the rules from Obama. So you have a president saying he can get anything done he wants, but blames others who aren't even in office for what he's doing.

That's all that matters.***The problem was never with the cages, as much as ill-informed people will tell you it was.

The problem was the zero-tolerance policy that required separating children from parents regardless of circumstance to serve as an immigration deterrence, even if the immigrants were seeking asylum (which is a completely legal avenue by the way). Under the Obama administration, the cages were built and used to separate families but only in specific circumstances like when the adults had a criminal history or for the children‚Äôs safety.

Isn't this like a murderer saying ""its not my fault, its the guy who made the gun fault""***Yes but he didn‚Äôt have to fill them with kids separated from their family***I feel it's important to note that while yes, the cages were built under the Obama administration, they would only separate children at the border if the adults they were with were suspected of having committed a crime such as carrying drugs across the border, being a known murderer, being suspected of human trafficking, etc. They began to be built because they needed to keep the kids somewhere. It was under the Trump administration that this was expanded to be the default method when children come across the border regardless of the circumstances surrounding the crossing. And now we have over 500 kids and nowhere to put them. If anyone understands anything about psychology and child development, we just created 500+ adults who will hate this country with every fiber of their being. And we need to get these kids back to their parents ASAP.***Building a cage and filling it are two very different things. Learn to stop projecting and take responsibility for your vote.

Biden says he's not banning fracking immediately, he's also said he's banning any new fracking on federal land to transition to no fracking.

Trump's videos say Biden wants to get rid of fracking, which is also true.

Then Trump claiming Biden wants to ban fracking the moment he assumes office is misleading, right?***This is my favorite fact check.  Great job washington post, Biden's quote was way better in context /s https://youtu.be/o22pLCyj5wI***""Independent fact checkers"" = Biden staff doing damage control after he said he never made a stance to ban fracking***Because it is. It‚Äôs pieces together video of Joe talking about fracking on federal land and its being used to look like he would ban fracking.

I know none of you will, but it‚Äôs a good idea to.***Yeah I think he is saying that he is not ‚Äúbanning‚Äù fracking outright but aims to transition away from it over time to more clean energy alternatives. A ban would imply immediate halting of fracking when the ban goes in place. I do think he plans to ban ‚Äúnew‚Äù fracking though. So this video is flagged as a matter of what the definition of ban is. 
End note: I think this he said she said shit is stupid af. Taking things they say out of context and twisting their words around till it fits your personal narrative is hurting both you and America, both sides do this. Yes joe Biden lies, yes Donald trump lies, get over it, everybody lies everyday. Don‚Äôt get into these petty little arguments over things people say. Make your choice based off of character and what you think is best for you personally. Have your own opinion about it.***Watch the video, Biden never directly said he‚Äôd ban fracking.  Harris however did.  

Here‚Äôs the thing, I watched the video and formed my own opinion.  I don‚Äôt need a platform to fact check things for me.***Fracking is not good***To be fair, Biden had said he agreed with Bernie Sanders on his anti-fracking stance in a democratic primary debate, but he subsequently came out to correct the record several times on national media to confirm he is not anti-fracking. This suggests to me that the worst case is really him being unclear/confused in the debate (nothing new there), not being an ardent anti-fracker. 

Also that video which FB has banned is so heavily edited I was pretty unconvinced. It's really easy to string statements together to prove a point when you aggressively crop context. 

Example:

Biden: ""What's Trump's stance on Mexicans?""

Cropped Trump: ""...they're rapists"".

The above Trump soundbite has to be one of the most misinterpreted and abused ones out there. He was clearly saying Mexico is sending ""their rapists"" - not that all Mexicans are rapists. The context completely changes the meaning and the Democrats spin the hell out of it. 

Not saying it should have been banned but this video is hardly a smoking gun.***Anyway, please just get out there are vote for the candidate that doesn‚Äôt have every social media platform in their pocket***‚ÄúFact checkers‚Äù employed by the DNC!***Wow***It was probably an out of context post, he said and reiterated tonight that the only fracking he would ban fracking on FEDERAL land. But is not against fracking in general and it is in fact a part of his plan.***No, Facebook is correct here.

Any company would have to do this.***That's some serious ""We've always been at war with Eastasia."" shit right there.***So the video of Biden actually saying a thing is ‚Äúfalse information‚Äù because he never said the thing that the video shows him saying...

Anyway, Biden said he would ban fracking on *federal land*.

That's in the context of protecting certain places, like national forests.

He also said we need to *transition* away from fossil fuels *over time*.

That's in the context of retraining American workers so they continue to have a job when the oil industry contracts.***I‚Äôm posting this here to make sure and remind my fellow conservatives that DT is not who he says he is. Want to judge a candidate on his own words? Me too.

The sound bite which has been taken out of context and has been repeatedly clarified by the Biden campaign is Biden saying, ‚Äúno fracking ‚Äî no new fracking.‚Äù He is referencing his position that he would stop new oil and gas exploration on federal lands. The actual effect of this would allow the majority of fracking to continue. Therefore, using this clip to claim that Biden ever held the position that he was 100% against fracking is misleading and therefore false.***How dare facebook says my fake video is fake.

We couldn't afford to really tackle any of her health issues. Fast forward to a few years later, we got married and I got a good job and got her on my health insurance and her health issues were damaging her the whole time and now she is basically disabled.

I absolutely didn't get to keep any of it, the mandate that ""wasn't a tax"" was absolutely deemed a tax by the courts, and the coverage I ended up with was more expensive every year for a steady decrease in the quality of care that I was paying for.  

Literally *fuck* Bidencare; I barely survived his last foray into cannibalizing our already-not-awesome Healthcare System***My biggest issue with Obamacare was how so many companies forced people down to part time to avoid paying for their insurance. 

10 years later and my wife is still affected by this policy.***Healthcare is a racket in the US. 

We pay twice as much as all the other OECD countries for healthcare, and are last in healthcare quality... On top of it 10% can't afford what we have, and another 30% are underinsured.

Until we get our healthcare cost and value in line with the rest of the comparable countries you can pick whatever plan you like. They will all fail. Socialize it. Privatize it. None of it matters.

Other OECD countries pay 10% of their GDP to insure everyone. We pay double that and can't properly insure almost half of the US.

I consulted for a company who managed emergency room doctors. I by chance saw a list of their payroll. Doctors making $200,000 to $300,000... A month. I spoke to a woman who described her accounting job for a local hospital as ""hiding how much money the hospital makes... so people don't want to kill us.""

10 days of insulin in the US is $300, and you die without it. Cost in Canada is $30.***I had a solid Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan for my family. It was $239/month with $3000 deductible. No copays on normal doctor appts. Specialist was $50. ER was $50. Urgent Care was no copay.

Got a letter saying our plan was canceled. Obamacare market ""silver"" plan was $450/month based on our income, and deductible was $13,500. Copays everywhere through the roof. I think like an urgent care copay was $75 (though out of pocket most urgent cares are $100 anyway so why am I paying this much?). If I wanted the Gold Obamacare plan my expenses were going to be like $600 a month.

Note, this was back in like 2010 or so, just my wife and our 1 new baby. The rates when I ended up checking in like 2015 were nearly $1000 a month. It was insane. I was a pro-Bernie Democrat in those days too, even went to his rally where I live in Tucson when he first announced. Believed the lies that the only reason Obamacare was bad was because Republicans must've neutered it somehow.

Woke up late 2015 once I started listening to Trump, as I wanted to hear this joke of a candidate for myself after the media told me he was this huge major racist and I was laughing myself how such a buffoon could run for President so decided to hear his speech. Realized the media completely exaggerated and mischaracterized his entire speech and outright lied about it. Realized I sort of agreed with what he was saying. Listened to more. Agreed more. Then listened to Republican debates and ended up becoming Ted Cruz and Rand Paul fans, still not really on the Trump train, though that happened in 2016 near the end of the primary.

All I can say is this... Obamacare is an absolute garbage piece of crap and I can't believe, looking back, that I though the Democrats were so amazing for passing that piece of legislation, as it doubled my healthcare costs overnight for my family, I lost my health insurance plan. My long time primary care doctor didn't accept any of the ObamaCare plans, so I lost my doctor as well (who I have since returned to once I got off that garbage through insurance from work), another thing I have come to realize was a lie that supposedly wouldn't happen.***Before I get downvoted to oblivion I'm not trying to oppose this statement. But can we get some stats on this? I just feel it's not very classy to make a claim and not provide support.***Lyin biden***Didn't lose it, but might as well of.

jgfp5o,"I've never understood why Democrats don't focus this message to such things like buildings rather than cars. Why not put together a plan to put solar panels on the roof of every home/business. It's seems so much easier to do that, then figure out how you're going to power all these vehicles, while we are having rolling blackouts in California.

Or, if solar is so awesome, why aren't they building massive solar farms in the desert, non stop? Like, if it's a system that has all the benefits they're saying it does, then it should be a national thing, like a road network that pays back the gov't with commerce and efficiency. The way they talk about this technology, it's a 'no brainer' that we should have it. Everywhere.

But the way it works now, is that all these solar initiatives are costs that the consumer has to take on personally. Even though there are subsides to help pay, you first must come up with the cash, and get the system, and then it takes 5-10yrs to make your money back. Maybe I'm rambling, but the way Democrats talk about all this alternative energy, it should be a mandate, just like it's their duty to build a system of roads. And because it isn't a mandate, is a big red flag to me that promises don't match actual results.

I think a lot of people would get on board with ""transitioning"" to other forms of energy. But they way they want to go about it feels like the most disruptive, expensive, and inconvenient, method they could pick. Almost like if it tastes bad, then it must be good for you.

Correlation doesn't equal causation, but when there's smoke, there's fire. There's a reason gas was stupid expensive back in the Obama/Biden era and it's now much, much cheaper. I never thought I would be paying $1-$2 a gallon for gas again after paying over $5 a gallon.***Biden is already promising to transition away from oil***I'm sorry to rain in on the parade but the US president doesn't have that much direct influence on oil prices. 80% of global oil reserves come from OPEC. The prices are low because collectively they don't want to cut production. There are reasons for that - putting pressure on Iran' economy, drowning out new competitors like shale from being financially viable enough to build infrastructure around, internal fighting between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, etc.

That's on top of the drastic drop in demand for transportation and fuel. Airlines, jet fuel, etc are practically at all time lows and futures are looking bleak. This is your other driver on price.

Sorry this has very little to do with the US president, and the low prices themselves aren't necessarily a good sign for the economy, which also believe it or not is way bigger than a US president's policies.


When prices start rising, it's a sign most likely that OPEC is starting to cut production again.***In the last year of the Obama administration gas prices averaged 2.14 a gallon.

Although, they are an important aspect. 

The most important aspect is where the oil is coming from. Thanks to fracking, the USA is a net exporter of oil now. We are not reliant at all in foreign oil. This means places like Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc hold less sway over our global decisions. 

By Biden saying he plans on ending fracking, this means that he plans on putting us back on international oil dependency. In other words, his foreign friends recognize that a USA that isn‚Äôt dependent on other countries mean we can‚Äôt be kept in line with the global agenda. 

As far as pricing goes, fracking as a technology has been developing extremely quickly. It will soon be more cost effective than any other form of oil recovery.

With pressure from the left, it most assuredly will not survive.***Where did Biden say he‚Äôll renew it?***The left don‚Äôt understand energy‚Äôs not just cheap gas when you fuel up.

[https://imgur.com/a/EERIQTG](https://imgur.com/a/EERIQTG)***The comments in this thread are concerning to me.  They show a fundamental misunderstanding of the economic and regulatory structure of oil and gas.  Oil and gas are commodities and are governed by the same general rule as all other commodities - supply and demand.  How soon we forget about ""drill here, drill now!""  Well, we drilled there, and we drilled then (under the GWB, Obama, and Trump administrations).  The result - the United States became the largest producer of oil in the world.  You can't dump that much oil on the market without the price of the commodity coming down.  We saw the effect of that in 2015-2016.  A weakening Chinese economy, and a glut of oil from US producers caught supply up with demand and pushed prices down.  The Saudis and Russians also worked to capitalize on that opportunity to regain market share and dropped the price to $26/bbl.  The stabilization in prices after that bust only came though a decrease in production from OPEC.  Even the surging economy of 2017-2019 (demand) wasn't enough to push oil prices back to the 2007-08 highs because of the increased output of U.S. reserves that had been tapped during 15 years of the hydraulic fracturing boom (supply).  I will echo a comment earlier in the thread - the president has some effect on oil prices, but not to the difference of $120/bbl oil and $60/bbl oil.  Also, stripping all environmental regulations from local producers would still not bring production costs down to a level that is competitive with middle east producers.  Oil is incredibly CHEAP to produce there.  Energy independence has a price, and that price is lower revenues for local producers.  Why do I think I have the expertise to comment on this topic?  I follow the oil and gas industry pretty closely as I consult for a large oil producer (focusing more on their mining properties) and live in a state that is highly dependent on O&G revenues.  I have dabbled in upstream, midstream, and downstream aspects of O&G in my career.***$1.59 where I live. Way more new trucks on the roads the last 4 years.

However, they are detrimental to our domestic oil and gas industry. I was laid off from my job in the Oil and Gas industry because of this price crash due to COVID. These current oil prices of $40 a barrel are not sustainable for the industry at all and they must increase for the sake of our oil and gas economy which so many states rely on. No company wants to produce under these circumstances because it‚Äôs simply not profitable. Now I‚Äôm certainly not saying they need to be around $140 a barrel like they were under Obama, but $60 to $70 a barrel would be a healthy number for production companies that rely on hydraulic fracking in shale plays.***........

They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult.

What are we fucking China?***The LapTop is just a made up conspiracy he says also. Liar liar plants for hire.***How could he not know he said this? It‚Äôs been all over the internet for several weeks. He doesn‚Äôt know enough about the internet to be president.***Quite seriously, I really think CNN is dying inside with all this going on and not being able to report it. The greatest largest election  story in the past 4 years and they can‚Äôt say a word. A news outlet that has been told to shut up and stay quiet. If there are any real reporters there they must be beside themselves reporting things like, ‚ÄúIn other news Joe was seen leaving his house today‚Äù. If you think about it it‚Äôs hilarious. A news outlet told not to report news. LOL!!!

Edit. I was told by people CNN won‚Äôt do the story because there are known and named sources to it. They only use anonymous sources for their stories.***Objectively speaking, isn‚Äôt this video misleading  because it cuts off in many cases right after a yes or no answer and completely ignores the explanation of his position afterwards?  Where there is an explanation, it seems consistent with what he‚Äôs been saying about no new fracking and phasing out fossil fuels in favor of green energy.***Serious question - he said in the debate that he will definitely phase it out, not ban it. Which is the same as what he is saying in these videos. He plans to replace the fracking jobs with renewable jobs. Does that make sense? Or is it unrealistic for him to replace all those jobs that are eventually phased out?***I don't think I can post the link here, but check out this beauty of a headline over on CNN Politics right now:

""Fact check: Biden falsely claims he never opposed fracking""***Is this regarding fracking on federal ground or is this about transitioning to new cleaner energy that will produce jobs so people aren‚Äôt out of work? 

I thought he said in the debate that he wants to make a transition. It is t going to be a clear cut. 

I may be wrong. This tape is pretty damning. 

I hope FB shuts down the edited version of 60 minutes and let‚Äôs the unedited version air. 

What a mess overall. I wish we could find common ground with the Democrats. Act like Americans instead of Reps vs. Dems. 

We need help. The back and forth fighting has to stop. People are dying, businesses are closing, my friends have lost loved ones, our relationships with the world are a joke. Regardless the reality, it is viewed as a joke and deemed by scientists around the world as a complete mess. 

Neighbor to neighbor are taking a different approach in my neighborhood. No one knows what to do. The ones not wearing masks are getting tested all the time. ‚ÄúOoops I got exposed. Ooops I did it again.‚Äù 

Anyways... I‚Äôm angry by the lies on both sides. I‚Äôm tired of the posturing on both sides. 

I don‚Äôt feel safe now. Still not sure what anyone, including our President, is going to do to stop the spread. It‚Äôs not getting better. It‚Äôs getting worse. ND has the worst infections per capital in the world. Come on... neither had a defined plan. 

Is there a plan? 

I‚Äôm a tired.***Everyone who has said this already got downvoted but I guess I'll give it a shot... The question at hand was whether or not Biden said he will BAN fracking. Biden has not said he would ban fracking. He has said that it will be phased out over time, not occur on federal lands and not be government subsidized. If oil companies can continue to keep prices low and consumers are still buying and investing in fossil fuels, that shouldn't be a threat to these fracking companies. But, over time, it will be impossible to compete with solar, wind, nuclear etc. It is preferred by many consumers, can be entirely domestic, and is significantly better for the environment. Green energy will create many jobs. Jobs that folks currently working in the fossil fuel industry can potentially transition to. It's an unfortunate reality in capitalism that you are not guaranteed that your career will be relevant and necessary forever. There are many professions that simply don't exist anymore, and that is a sign of progress and shouldn't be feared. Humanity is adaptable.***So Biden says he'll end fracking in a plan to phase out fossil fuels by X date for wind and solar. If his plan could generate the same amount, if not more, jobs and entrepreneurship, would you support it? Also curious on your guys' thoughts about nuclear energy and hydroelectric power.***Even CNN did an article saying Biden lied...***This wasn‚Äôt the conversation at all in the debate. Trump asserted Biden has vowed to BAN fracking. Biden asked to bring up the tape. Where are the videos of him saying to ban fracking? Please bring it up.***Said he would ban fracking on federal land.*

You guys don‚Äôt like the media taking things out of context, but here we are. 

I also support banning fracking in Yosemite and the Grand Canyon, hopefully you would too.***I‚Äôm curious, does anyone else here wish he woulda stuck with it? Idk about you, but I‚Äôd prefer if oil companies didn‚Äôt pump cancer-causing chemicals like benzene into the ground where I get my water. 

Would also rather have some nature left for my kids than pay less for gas.***Just wondering why both candidates say they support fracking so much?  It's one of the most destructive resource extraction methods we know of.  Why do Americans want it on their land so much?***We're going to end fossil fuel? Are you completely stupid?! Listen, I want us to use a renewable energy source as much as any other tree humping hippie, but this country is too depended on it. 

It's like drinking coffee every day, eventually your body grows a dependence on it, and it's hard to quit. Doesn't mean you can't quit, just means you have to slowly ween yourself off it.***Listen, fat. Joe is not banning fracking, but phasing it out so there will be no fracking.  

Shit, that sounds about the same.***Come on man! - Joe Biden official response.***He said that because he knows there's not many if any places Trump could or anyone could post that would actually matter. Stupid currrupt media!***Both of them lie and twist the truth all the time. But let‚Äôs be clear about Biden‚Äôs context here, he wants to begin phasing out fossil fuels because that‚Äôs what we need to do to save the planet. He‚Äôs not gonna ban fracking outright. He‚Äôs also trying to win Pennsylvania so yeah, he‚Äôs gonna make it sound as nice as possible.***Okay so heres my genuine question: Would ending fracking really even be that bad? Even if you dont understand climate change, would it really be that bad to focus on cheaper and better alternatives like solar/wind/water? Sure there would be a decrease in oil/gas jobs, but there would be an increase in green jobs instead. Why WOULDNT we want the US to be more self-reliant energy wise?***Do people that want to ban things like coal and fracking and oil and so on even understand how natural resources and energy infrastructure work? Renewable energy is great but most of the forms of renewable clean energy we have aren't efficient enough to meet our energy demands at this time, and the cleanest and most efficient power source we have is nuclear power and they want to ban that, too. It's like their understanding of coal and nuclear power comes from movies. Coal is one of the only natural fuel sources america actually has a lot of, and technology has come a long way in making it burn cleaner and produce less waste. Most of our power still comes from coal. And the military has used nuclear reactors for decades without incident. It's safe. But they want to give you feelings about 3 eyed fish and godzilla and shit.***Fossil fuels =/= suddenly stop fracking.
We would slowly move away from fracking so we don‚Äôt have an unemployment crisis like when we moved away from coal. Former fracking employees could work for nuclear power plants . The problem is Biden doesn‚Äôt support nuclear energy which is why this is a bad plan.***Astonishing. That people like my mom, who watches CNN and ABC only for news sources, will never recall these mentions and never see this compilation. 

She'll also never hear the facts regarding Hunter and Joe Biden's criminal activities. 

So 1984...***HE SAID NO NEW FRACKING. IT IS IN THE CLIP. Why is this so hard for people to understand? This is not the same thing as ending fracking.***So, my issue here is that, according to Biden, he‚Äôs not going to ban fracking. If you‚Äôre really a fracking enthusiast, you‚Äôll still be allowed to. He‚Äôs just going to make clean energy the more incentivized option, and end fracking by making it so that no one will want to anymore.***I honestly don't understand. Isn't ending fracking a good thing? So is this more so just calling him out for lying and flip flopping?  Because aren't most politicians guilty of this?***As they‚Äôd say ‚Äúthose clips were taken out of context‚Äù***Whats so wrong with ending fracking, dont we want to live?***I really hope he ends fracking.***I think a goldfish  has a longer memory span than Joe.***   Fracking tech, procedures and regulations have advanced considerably in the last 10 -15 years, and all but eliminated any environmental contaminations that take place. While not perfect, a single pad with modern drilling and stimulation techniques can easily do the work of 30-40 conventional wells from the past. It‚Äôs also the reason the USA has become (on paper) energy independent, and IMO is the reason for no new wars / decline in the presence of the US military in the Middle East. 
    So in closing fracking is far from ideal, but it is not the boogie man that many groups have tried to make it out to be. Like it or not the entire oil industry will go the way of the farrier sooner or later, but for the next 20-30 years it‚Äôs here to stay.***I don‚Äôt understand whats so bad about starting to move away from using fossil fuel to a more renewable and cleaner type of energy? I mean even the big oil companies have been starting to invest in renewable energy. We knows a limit to how much oil we can get from the ground so why not transition what we can to something that isnt going to run out? I mean we‚Äôll always need oil for plastics, tires, roofing materials, etc but the areas like our cars and electricity if we can use something more sustainable why is this bad? I might be completely missing something here. Could someone enlighten me?***Funny how no one is even mentioning this, while all of Twitter is talking about ‚Äúcoyotes‚Äù and all of Trumps ‚Äúlies.‚Äù Let‚Äôs hope America can see through the left wing media....

They‚Äôre coping***This is very misleading because in the debate he specified no fracking on federal land, but this clip cuts that part out. This is textbook definition of ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù.  When you have to lie or mislead to prove your point...your already losing.***I find the ‚Äúfact-checkers‚Äù defending Biden on this when there‚Äôs LITERALLY video of Biden saying he will - it‚Äôs just comical. 

And how FAR they‚Äôre willing to cherry-pick Trump and noting it as ‚Äúpants on fire false‚Äù. It‚Äôs a leftists newspeak game.***So why do people WANT fracking in the first place?  Doesnt it fuck up the ground?***He's an embarrassment. Everyone knows that fracking is extremely dangerous and needs to be banned.***This is a joke. Cutting off Joe‚Äôs response super early to make a point is painfully dishonest. No moderately intelligent undecided voter would take this as definitive proof***Watched both videos.

There is no debate that both Biden and Harris want to end oil as a business in the United States, which would mean only one thing:  We go back to buying our oil from people who want to kill us.

It is the medication.***I posted this in several subs and the mental gymnastics they do around it should be part of the Olympics***isnt ending fracking a good thing? it is horrible for our planet, and switching to cleaner energy source doesnt mean loss of jobs, just means workers have to shift their skillsets, which is something I have to do at my normal job all the time.

It's almost guaranteed that the two parties will make more and more promises right before the election in order to gain votes, but then ignore them during their presidency.***If you like fracking, you are selfish.

celebrating that we've reached a previously predicted peak while still going up is kind of like bragging that only your garage is gone while your house is still on fire.***The vast majority of the deaths from COVID are people dying with COVID not from COVID (exclusively).  Given the average age of death is around 80 years old many of these people were knocking on heaven's door as it was.

Fact, if you are under age 70 and in good health you more likely to die in an automobile accidents. What this virus does highlight are the number of people that have been obese for long periods of time and the health issues they now suffer. Go to any airport and just watch the number of grossly overweight 50 year olds that have to be wheelchair to the airplane because they can't walk down the ramp.  Tell me they aren't a death waiting to happen-from just about anything.  But talking at personal health would mean personal responsibility, which apparently no longer is in vogue.***Uhm, the 100-200k number was for the run of the pandemic. We are sitting at 223k (and based on excess death data the number is closer to 300k) in the middle of it, with 5-6k dying week after week. Seems somebody is at war with numbers***People somehow completely forget that we quarantined not to stop the virus but to slow it! It was to make sure the hospitals don‚Äôt get over filled. This virus was passing through and killing no matter who was president***I just shake my head when I see idiots blame Trump for a fucking virus lol. It's a VIRUS. You can't stop a virus. Yes, it could help to wear a mask and social distance but I've spoken to a few people who followed all the precautions yet still got. If Biden was president, the same number of people would have died***why does everyone feel the need to defend the president on this issue? i feel like, whoever would have been the president (no matter the party) in an instance like this, the blame would be on them by default. that‚Äôs just one of the cons of being on duty; accountability is required when one is on watch. Why don‚Äôt we help the guy out and actually put the damn masks on and stop the spread?***Joe Biden called Trump's action 'engaging in hysterical xenophobia' ‚Äì an attack Biden repeated several times in the following weeks following the travel restrictions***Lol remember the 3 million dead prediction. These people are sick.***Does not matter. The memory of your average DemoKKKRat only goes back 5 minutes.***Great, can we reopen the economy now so the damage that was done can start to heal?***Trump is also responsible for all the deaths worldwide! Not just the US!***NO! Trump should have thrown himself in front of the COVID like Clint Eastwood in that secret service movie. Nothing less will suffice.***I'm all about doing a de-brief and lessons learned on the initial response to this pandemic. I don't imagine things were done ""perfectly"". I'm certain that under different leadership there'd still be Covid and certainly a lot of people dead in the US from it. So to people who accuse Trump of having done a terrible job. What would the death count be with someone else? I worry that someone inline with Cuomo's politics could have recommended the same actions he took nationally, and really killed millions of people. Thankfully the rest of the country didn't follow the lead of New York and without their inflated numbers, the US is right inline with this prediction. 

Are people seriously suggesting that we'd have had ZERO deaths and/or no COVID if Hillary had won? Not even to make this about US politics, basically the entire US response was crippled by misinformation from china and the WHO. Sure, harsher limits on travel could have been imposed earlier, but no one was pushing hard for that. Fauci was saying Americans had nothing to worry about well into February. Pelosi was telling people to visit Chinatown and deblasio was telling people to go out to Broadway shows. Hell, LA had their Marathon in early March. I don't imagine any of that would have changed under a Hillary presidency. We'd just be getting constant spin about how bad it could have been and how her unwavering leadership helped get us through the first wave and reduce the fatality rate of the virus, blah blah blah.***Hey get this truth outta here. Shit don‚Äôt belong in politics.***But Covid is still killing people. The pandemic isnt over. Even in the article itself it dosnt say ""200k deaths in 2020"" or something. Its a number for until the pandemic is over. I fele like this article is doing itself a disservice?***Yeah but Covid isn't over. As Trump says we are learning to live with it.***That was a prediction of 100-200k deaths *total.* And this is not over.***The 2.2 million number is every bit as fabricated as every other number we‚Äôve heard along the way, almost all of which have been criminally inaccurate***U.S. population - 331,617,988\*

COVID cases (through 10/23) - 8,366,221\*\*

COVID deaths (through 10/23) - 214,845\*\*

So as of this time, 2.5% of the population has been identified as having/had COVID.  Of that, 2.5% have died of COVID related symptoms.  97.5% of the population has not been identified as having/had COVID and of those who did, 97.5% are still alive.

Biden said last night that there are predictions for another 200,000 deaths during the dark days of winter.  That would mean another 8+ million will have to catch it.  He also said if masks are worn all the time, still 100,000 will die.***And so the US is over 200k deaths and no end is in sight?  Doesnt that mean that we've already used up all the predicted deaths and all the ones over the winter are above and beyond that?***Hey retards, the prediction was that many deaths by FEBRUARY 2021.  Idk if you guys have realized this but we surpassed that projection in early October 2020, or about 5 months early.

In the same time period we're now projected to have around 400,000+ deaths, aka DOUBLE***I didn‚Äôt realize the pandemic was over and we can do a final tally.***It just frustrates me that we can‚Äôt show this to someone and they believe us***I guess Cuomo and other NE governors didn't get the memo from her***so yea. up to 200k if we do things perfectly. That tracks because ""up to"" means ceiling, and we're past 200k and we don't know when it will end. Are we halfway through? 1/4? I don't think this says what you think it says.***That article has no source or legitimacy. Confirmation bias at its finest.***If Trump would have only....
If he didnt.. um..... If Biden had been in the White House he‚Äôd.. um .. the virus.. would.... 
 
Screw you! ORANGE MAN BAD!***These projections, ranging from ""Doing Everything Perfectly"" \~200k deaths to ""Doing Nothing"" \~2MM deaths, aren't those total numbers after the dust has settled?  

Aren't these projections for the TOTAL deaths after we have gotten over this in it's entirety?

These projections weren't predicting that we would have \~2MM deaths 8 months in if we did nothing, they were projecting \~2MM deaths TOTAL right?  

The health professionals are saying that the public won't have access to the vaccine until mid 2021.  We are recording DAILY death counts of \~1k.  So saying that the projections say after all is said and done, if we only have \~200k deaths we did everything perfect, and the Trump administration is saying yeah we are at that number with \~1k dying daily and no end in sight, we have done a great job!!??***Is the pandemic over? Let's check out in 3months and then 6months.***Doesn‚Äôt she mean 200,000 for the entire pandemic like the next however long?***Up to 200k covid deaths by the end of the pandemic.. were entering a third surge now.***10 months later, still calling it the Wuhan virus ffs.***Citing this prediction with no date attached is rather misleading imo. 100-200k deaths by what point in time? This could very well be referencing the total death toll when we are considered ""past""/""done""/have defeated COVID, which in reality may be many more months away. For ex this IHME forecast predicts nearly double the UPPER limit of OP's by Febuary [https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=total-deaths&tab=trend](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=total-deaths&tab=trend)***What was the time frame? If they said by the time its all over then...sorry to say, but we have a long ways to go.***Unfortunately it's over 200k and we just passed 80k new cases today so it's not over...***What‚Äôs tragic is that the pandemic is not over. We have failed***We are at 220k and counting.  We are also heading into flu season which will certainly make the pandemic accelerate which we are seeing happen.  We should get off of what Fauci said at the beginning of the Pandemic- he said those things because there was a shortage of PPE for front lines workers.  Trump cannot blame Fauci because Trump knew very early that this virus was airborne and more lethal than the flu and affects everyone.  They were all in on the mask lie like it or not.***Whoa whoa you can‚Äôt say that. That‚Äôs illegal. If you say that, how can Biden blame Trump for not doing enough??***I‚Äôm skeptical of all the models that were obviously political in order to scare the hell out of everyone. 

What I think is that Trump has spun this to his advantage as a politician would. Trump doesn‚Äôt believe the virus is as bad as the news said. 

But it seems he‚Äôs shooting it back at the dems, who only care about if people wear the mask or not, and gaining ground with it.***I mean, the virus hasn‚Äôt run it‚Äôs full course yet? Unless it went full stop and it‚Äôs done?***Hindsight is 20/20. We all knew of the coronavirus back in January/February. We had no idea it would cause as many deaths as it did (still debateable who actually died FROM Covid vs. Died WITH Covid. 

If a country shuts down an economy and the virus was nothing...people would complain. 

If the country doesn't shut down an economy until people get sick...people would complain. 


The fact is, we are not ALL at risk of DYING. We did what was best based on what we knew of coronavirus at that time.  

This argument that ""we could've done this..."" is moot in that you have more knowledge of the impact the virus has today than you did earlier this year. Additionally, saying there would be more or less deaths had we not taken the course that we did or taken a different couse, is purely speculation and we will never know. 

I'm sorry to anyone who loses a loved one or their own life in an unexpected way, but I'm sick of people being fake outraged by 200k deaths from covid and wanting to charge a POTUS with murder for something he has literally no control over.***The only thing undeniably true and precise about Covid-19, is fear.***That also assumes some time period, probably 6 months or a year.  If you extrapolate at this point after a year the total deaths still only will be ~250,000.  And at that point vaccine distribution will have started so yeah.  At worst Trump's response combined with all the states (including those with protests and putting old folks in homes with the virus) is going to be marginally worse than a best case scenario.**** USA has  699 dead / 1 million so far
* Germany has 120 dead / 1 million so far
* South Korea has 9 dead / 1 million so far

It seems that 10 dead / 1 million was achievable ""if we do things almost perfectly"", USA is only doing 80 times worse than that.***It is still a lot higher death count than european countries. 
Why can the richest economy in the world not manage to keep their citizen safe? 
I do not want to blame Trump for all of this. Of course there are very many factors contributing to this like the American health care system in general, but his diminishing of the threat and his attitude about masks have costs thousands of lives. 

I can understand concerns about a total shutdown of the economy, but if you want to keep your economy running you should at least propose and preferably enforce the simple measures to keep workers and customers healthy. 

The US has skipped the dip in cases that most european countries have seen and is directly heading for a huge winter spike.***I‚Äôm a veteran and I was stationed in South Korea, a country the size of Rhode Island and a population 6 times less than the U.S 

SK having a population of 55 million, had around 3 thousand deaths so why is it that the United States has had 73 times more deaths in a much bigger country with more wealth and a supposed better medical system?***ITT - people cherry-picking facts to justify their ignorance of the fact that 230,000 Americans (officially, and likely 300,000 unofficially) have died due to a pandemic that could have been curbed and stomped by the end of April if our country was run even remotely well.  Oh, and people aren‚Äôt done dying - 855 Americans lost their fight with COVID yesterday alone.***100,000-200,000 is not THE range the administration predicted. In the beginning, estimates ranged from a couple thousand, to 2.2 million, and even to ""nearly zero in a few weeks.""

And we've already hit 220% of the lower end of that range, [which is the one trump said ""we would be substantially under.""] (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/10/trump-says-us-will-have-substantially-under-100000-deaths-from-coronavirus-lower-than-initial-estimates.html)

And that was April 10th, 4 full weeks after the US began realizing the first spike.

As much as you would like to delude yourself into thinking this death toll was inevitable, or that this administration has done their best, it is simply untrue. It wasn't. And they haven't.***Well we are above that ...***So now that we are roaring past 200k with no end in sight and in the middle of a 3rd wave, can we admit we didn‚Äôt do perfectly yet?***And we‚Äôve exceeded that by +25,000, already‚Ä¶***You guys are talking like this is over snd a final number. We are already way past the best case scenario of between 100k and 200k, and things are only ramping up as we get into the colder months. 

You can defend this administration‚Äôs work on the economy if you want, but you‚Äôre fooling yourselves if you think this wasn‚Äôt catastrophic mismanagement of a health crisis.***So you agree, a whole lot was done wrong and the administration is partly to blame for the extra 20k deaths now, and the deaths that have yet to happen?***So we‚Äôre over what she said is absolute best case scenario, and deaths and cases continue to rise again?***Do you guys not realize that COVID is only half over? We're going to have a second wave this winter and it's unpreventable. We will have, at minimum, 400k deaths total.***Oh damn, you‚Äôre right. Checkmate liberals.

jgmgzy,"TLDR: President Trump missed opportunities, and Joe probably won this debate, and I'm just not optimistic with this election.

1- For instance, the tough line economically with China is as important as much as the Corporate tax rate being more competitive globally to bring our Corps back home. Joe wants to roll back the Corporate tax rate, but China back in the driver's seat economically, and these are things that will ultimately drive our Corps (and jobs) back overseas.

2- Joe says Pres Trump is adversarial to our allies; well, maybe it's due when they look to us to be responsible for everything, pay for everything, while they sit back and get rich. It's like the relative wanting a temporary loan because they might miss a house payment, then the next time you visit them, they have all the movie channels on their cable, Netflix, and their 10 year old kid has the latest iPhone

3- Further, he missed the boat on the whole Green New Deal. What kinds of jobs are we talking about; it's government industry building. It's ripping apart our green spaces for wind and solar farms. Somehow fracking on federal land is bad, covering it in a sea of panels is okay. Al Gore once stated the problem with nuclear is it came in one size; extra large. Yet, we're okay with 150 foot tall windmills covering acre after acre. He touched on the inherent issues with them (they don't supply consistent power), but the message was lost.

4- As far as health care, exactly what with ACA is health care? ACA is an insurance **scheme**, plain and simple. Easy retort; we want to give people affordable HEALTH CARE, not another health INSURANCE SCHEME. 

The real issue I see here, is there is no definitive alternative vision expressed to counter the ""plans"" from Joe. Joe is doing the classic politician approach, creating a plan without actually doing any significant problem analysis on the issue. Plans first, retrofit the problems to match the plans put in place. It's why issues continue to go unresolved and government gets bigger and more expensive.",0.9477,0,0,Positive,"3 Ways Donald Trump‚Äôs Debate Performance Will Affect The Race -- These three points were clear victories for the president, likely to cut through the noise and directly reach Americans in the last two weeks of the election.",reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/jgmgzy/3_ways_donald_trumps_debate_performance_will/,10/23/2020,3 ways donald trump ‚Äô debate performance affect race -- three points clear victories president likely cut noise directly reach americans last two weeks election

**MYTH:**

>DHS has a policy to separate families at the border. 

**FACT:**

>DHS does not have a blanket policy of separating families at the border.   However, DHS does have a responsibility to protect all minors in our custody.  This means DHS will separate adults and minors under certain circumstances.  These circumstances include: 1) when DHS is unable to determine the familial relationship, 2) when DHS determines that a child may be at risk with the parent or legal guardian, or 3) when the parent or legal guardian is referred for criminal prosecution. 

>* Familial Relationship ‚Äì If there is reason to question the claimed familial relationship between an adult and child, it is not appropriate to detain adults and children together.

>* Human Trafficking and Smuggling ‚Äì If there is reason to suspect the purported parent or legal guardian of human trafficking or smuggling, DHS detains the adult in an appropriate, secure detection facility, separate from the minor.  DHS continues to see instances and intelligence reports indicating minors are trafficked by unrelated adults, posing as a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù in an effort to avoid detention.

>* Safety Risk ‚Äì If there is reason to suspect the purported parent or legal guardian poses a safety risk to the child (e.g. suspected child abuse), it is not appropriate to maintain the adult and child together.

>* Criminal Prosecution ‚Äì If an adult is referred for criminal prosecution, the adult will be transferred to U.S. Marshals Service custody and any children will be classified as an unaccompanied alien child and transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services custody.

>In recent months, DHS has seen a staggering increase in the number of illegal aliens using children to pose as family units to gain entry into the United States. From October 2017 to February 2018, there was a 315% increase in the number of cases of adults with minors fraudulently posing as ‚Äúfamily units‚Äù to gain entry.***It's the term ""coyotes"" as people-smugglers not common knowledge? My heart always goes out to separated children, but not knowing what a coyote is is pretty ignorant***Sometimes I wonder if we overstate how stupid these people are, and then they completely validate my thoughts***Biden is very worried about 500 immigrant children separated from their parents.  The tens of thousands  of American children separated from their fathers due to his legislation.... not so much.***I can definitely see why people are upset seeing children ripped from families, but there really are some valid points in this thread that I hadn't even considered. The situation is not as black and white as it first seems.***Imma be honest, I didn‚Äôt even know what coyotes were. I thought Trump said something bad and fucked himself. Thank god coyotes actually means something.***when we saw pictures of nothing but children ... where did they think the parents were?***I have to admit I was ignorant of the issue and had no idea who coyotes are.

A) I was pretty sure he wasn't talking about literal animals

and

B) I looked it up online.

How is it possible that in this age someone writes dumb shit on twitter before doing the most basic research is beyond me and I refuse to believe all these people are sub 70 IQ.***My american girlfriend living in Canada had no idea what a coyote is and I had to explain the whole border situation that lead to Obama's kids in cages she's been so tuned in to the left her whole life she thought trump was calling all mexicans coyotes***These people, after the titanic sank, would have published an article reading

""Government refuses to locate parents of 100 children found at sea.""***Glad there isn‚Äôt any bears taking them across.***Their parents pay coyotes thousands to smuggle them so America can raise them.  Most democrats know it's a hoax just like they know wearing a mask is a hoax.  They play this game and Republicans immediately go on the defense.***I mean. This is true of some, but the 500 they're referring to legitimately are separated with unknown parents. Some of them came alone and don't know, some are with aunts and uncles and can't track down the parent, some parents purposefully don't respond so their child stays in the US, some came with their parents and the parents were deported and the kid wasn't and now they are legit separated. It's the last category that sucks and we all (left and right) want to resolve. It's not like we conservatives are happy this happened. It's tragic. Hopefully it's resolved. The Trump administration has found a lot of these kids parents. The 500 are the remaining amount. I believe they found 1000 parents already.***How bad would your country of origin have to be for you to be willing to do that in order to ensure they don't have to grow up there?***I didn‚Äôt know what a coyote was when the debate started. After hearing the term used twice it was pretty easy to figure out.***The same people that don't know who coyotes are, are the same people that try to lecture others on border control policies.***What is the US supposed to do with a bunch of unaccompanied minors anyway? Don't their countries of origin have children's services who could handle this better than we can?***The dumbest people always think they're so fucking smart.  Then other dumb libs like their comments because they will always support anything anti-Trump.***A good portion of those parents sent their children into the United States knowing that they would never see them again. Their point was to try and give them a better life. To them, the chance of separation was worth it. It doesn't matter if it was a Coyote or one of the illegal migration marches from South America that happened -- the fact is that this was an expected and accepted risk by the families involved.

The truth is that those 500 children likely will be taken in by the United States as eventual citizens, which is exactly what parents hope for.

As a father this is a heart breaking reality, but I think we have to really think about the entire situation and put ourselves in the shoes of these families. It is only a priviledged perspective that can think of this otherwise.***This is exactly the question I kept asking myself last night.  Why is it Trumps job to find the childrens parents?  Why haven't the parents come forward to claim their children?  

How are people this fucking stupid?!***Latin America is messed up. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if parents would leave their children in hopes that they find more opportunity in this country.***Houston here. I'm originally from the border so I'm well aware of what coyotes are.

What some of you may not be clear on is that the bulk of the coyotes are cartel affiliated.

So... it's more than possible the coyotes have simply \*KILLED\* the parents because the parents are of no use to them but the kids are a free ticket across the border for anyone who is going with them.***It's insulting how ignorant they are.

Big brain journaisming right there.***So its down 85% from the highest point? Not down 85% from one of the lowest points? Incredible, sure am glad we have these fact checkers to explain these things***Ok so here is the thing: Trump was talking about covid mortality: 17k dropping to 2.5k is a drop in mortality of 85%. However, mortality rate is the percent of covid cases which will result in death.***False, it's down 84.5% so he's clearly wrong in his rounding direction. Math is racist.***Lol. 

At least they could have actually changed the numbers. Ministry of Truth has work to do***There‚Äôs a difference between mortality rate and number of deaths. The number of deaths per week dropped but the mortality rate has increased. That‚Äôs what the fact checker is saying***Claim: Trump said, ‚ÄúIf you notice the [COVID-19] mortality rate is down 85%.‚Äù

This claim is false. It‚Äôs actually still 15% of what it was originally.***Trump is mistaken, or its at least vague if he was referring to the pace of deaths or the rate of deaths as a percent of cases.

Either way, to call it a ""lie"" is ludicrous. A ""lie"" means he knew it was wrong, and said it anyway. Nothing here shows he's lying, merely that he wasn't specific enough, or made a minor mistake among the piles of stats on COVID, and where semantic mistakes have been made by many.

Compare this to how they treat all the crap emanating from Biden. Case in point: Biden repeatedly claims his 1st wife was killed by a drunk driver, despite KNOWING thats not the case, and even apologizing for saying so years back...but now he's back saying it again. he KNOWS its false, and repeats it.***That is not a rate. The number of deaths decreasing is not a mortality rate. A rate is a percentage of deaths related to infections. Those who understand basic math will still see the claim as false.***So, # of deaths is not mortality rate... as this says mortality rate in January was 2% and the current observed mortality rate is 2.7%. Am I missing something?***Literally right between the two highlighted paragraphs it explains why that number is not the *mortality rate*. Right there in your screenshot!***> Mortality rate tracks the percentage of patients who die from a disease after being diagnosed

No, [it doesn't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate). ""Mortality rate, or death rate, is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time.""

They're talking, I think, about case fatality rate.

Edit: holy hell, every top-level comment in this thread is getting it wrong***Someone explain to me how, despite having 24% of India's population, and lightyear's worth better healthcare, not to mention sanitation - we are still leading the world in deaths?  


We are the 3rd most populous country in the world, yet Indonesia, who's 4th on the list, has just over 13,000 deaths.  


39% of our population has been tested, yet less than 7% of those are positive cases.***I like how this statement forces liberals to do racist math.***ITT: people that don‚Äôt understand the concept of a rate***Wait he said the mortality rate dropped 85% but it wasn‚Äôt the rate that dropped it was the actual amount of deaths compared between two different points in time***That‚Äôs... not what a mortality is ü§¶***So let me get this straight. Trump is technically telling the truth. But when Biden says he doesn‚Äôt want to ban fracking he‚Äôs lying? They‚Äôre both doing the exact same thing, except one is your candidate and the other isn‚Äôt. A lot of the people on this sub aren‚Äôt willing to admit that they‚Äôre as hypocritical as the left they claim to hate.***Operation dark winter is a dud***I'm amazed at the lack of math knowledge in this sub.

He said the mortality RATE is down 85%. Rate is number of deaths per case, not the total of all deaths.

What the fact checker is saying is that the TOTAL number of deaths is down 85%.***I just read what you posted, and its very clear that what Trump said was incorrect.  Your screenshot lays it out pretty clearly.  Did you read your own post?***wat

does anyone have the source?***Mortality rate and number of deaths are different statistics, how does a mortality rate of 2.7% drop 85%?***The 85% drop number is in the NUMBER OF DEATHS, not the RATE OF DEATHS. For the number to show an 85% drop in a RATE OF DEATH, there would have to be the same number of active cases. 

Let‚Äôs assume 200,000 active cases, just for example. 
17,077 people dying would be roughly an 8.54% death rate. (17,077/200,000 = 0.085385)
2,540 people dying would be a 1.27% death rate. (2,540/200,000 = 0.0127 yay, nice round number). 

Now, let‚Äôs find the percent change there. ((0.0127-0.085385)/0.085385 = -0.85226). Now, this number says there is an 85% drop in death rate. Keep in mind though, this is true IF AND ONLY IF there is the same number of active cases. It is a safe assumption that the number of active cases for the week of April 18 and October 10 are not the same. 

I‚Äôm too lazy to do the math for the actual rate of death. By some napkin math off of the article you posted above, the rate of death increased by 35%((0.027-0.02)/0.02 = 0.35). You can go look up the numbers and do it yourself if you need something more precise. Next time, please actually look at what the numbers mean.***Holy shit this is basic math. This means an 85% drop in WEEKLY DEATH not an 85% drop in MORTALITY RATE. 

Can you read the 3 paragraphs in this image?

Christ. Mortality rate != number of people dead in a week.

Trump made a false claim. That simple.***That‚Äôs... lol goddamn you guys are duuuuuumb. He said the mortality RATE was down 85%, that is massively different that a decrease in total number of deaths.

I think it was on Wednesday that 1000 people died. But please, keep telling us how Biden can‚Äôt be trusted because of the four people that died at Benghaaaaaaaaaaaziiiiiiii***This is why at a minimum statistics should be taught in public school with the same fundamental requirement that Algebra is. Unless you understand how statistics work or can be manipulated, you yourself are open for being manipulated.***Mortality rate does not equal number of deaths. Mortality rate is the % of people who die as compared to the total number of infections.***Parkour***HE‚ÄôS WRONG! but yes he was right***I'm sick of this shit. It's just constant non stop examples of pulling wool over peoples eyes.***The problem is that it implies that the rate recently went down by 85%. ‚Äú___ is down/up by x%‚Äù always implies that it was a recent trend.. rather than highest/lowest to the current percent***Why don‚Äôt we talk about the fact that the estimated mortality rate in general is down from 5% to 0.5%, since they were counting only hospitalized infections, which was an obvious overcount due to the infectiousness and asymptomatic rate, which we know back in Feb-March.***Trump: ""The sky is blue.""

Snopes: ""The claim is FALSE. 97% of scientists say Cyan and Magenta-colored thingie-ma-boobs combine in dark holes of gases yet discovered, and make the color blue.""***No, the claim is still false, they were saying that the rate Trump speaks of is a specific date comparison instead of month to month rate comparison which would be more accurate and reliable. They found the number he referenced, but it is a misleading statistic. Hence it being tagged as false.***I suppose if you accept that Trump does not understand what a rate is, then you're right. A decrease in deaths does not equal a decrease in mortality rate unless the case count stayed the same; it did not. 

So either: 1) Trump is correct and doesn't understand rates (as OP) or 2) He twisted information to make things sound better than they are***I love how most of his ""10 gazillion billion reported lies"" are just stupid little nitpicky things like this.***Mortality rate always means per case. Trump should have said that Covid deaths are *down* 85%.

If I told you that radiation poisoning has a ~0% mortality rate, you would call me crazy.***Mortality rate specially refers to the rate of diagnosed to deaths - its a strict scientific term.

Trumps is comparing the sum of deaths from the highest week and lowest week - yes, a decline of 85% but to claim the mortality rate is down 85% is 100% untrue as he‚Äôs misusing the term and misleading his supporters.

EDIT: anyone care to counter this argument rather than cowardly just downvoting?

Maybe I have to dumb it down...let‚Äôs do a baseball comparison:

Player A week 1 stats:

3/10 (3 hits in 10 at bats). Batting average =.300

Player A week 2 stats

6/20 (6 hits in 20 at bats). Batting average= .300

Trump would say ‚ÄúHIS BATTING AVERAGE INCREASED 100%!!!‚Äù

Wrong.

Simple math. If you disagree and just downvote and don‚Äôt respond you‚Äôre a coward******Is this the same article? It literally says its false then contradicts itself almost immediately. Journalism is dead.***This is why fact checkers need to go away, they are partisan pundits***Either he misspoke or you and he are both misinterpreting. The mortality rate, as pointed out in this screenshot, has risen. Trump claimed it fell. That's inaccurate


Total deaths in a single week declined when looking at these arbitrary deaths. Most likely he knew this specific number and accidentally misspoke on what it represents, but please don't continue to misrepresent the data without clarifying what it actually means***fact checkers are morons***I would think it makes total sense to compare today's numbers to January, before the virus even left China...I'm sure they reported accurately.  NOT***They know what they're doing. They're pandering to people too broken to read. They think there are more of them than us. Those people see ""This claim is false"" and stop reading because that's all their confirmation bias needs.***Weekly death count is different from mortality rate, though. Trump misspoke. All this medical terminology is super technical and super confusing. It‚Äôs good news but I‚Äôm disappointed he wasn‚Äôt as accurate as he could have been.***I don‚Äôt love trump but god do I hate the mainstream media‚Äôs raging hard on to prove how trump is always wrong even when he‚Äôs kinda or definitely right***Are you all even reading the text right front of you? It says mortality's increased, not gone down, and that Trump's confused between mortality rate and total deaths.***The point he was making is true, and the article confirms that. 

What they are getting him on is his choice of words. ‚ÄúMortality rate‚Äù technically means the case-fatality rate, meaning the % of people who catch it and die from it. That has not dropped 85%.***I'm really hoping we can get leadership that returns America to it's Christian values and focuses on how great our country can be.

But guys come onnnnnnn. Be smarter than this - ""mortality rate"" refers to the rate at which people die when diagnosed with the disease. 85% fewer people may have died, but that doesn't mean the chance you are going to die when diagnosed with the disease decreased by 85%. If he is saying the 'rate' decreased by  85% but it actually only went from 2.7% to 2% he is wrong. Not that the left is any more honest than this, but this is Trump trying to mislead the American people and we should be good enough to distinguish truth from bullshit and this thing that he said is bullshit.

Seeing posts like this in here really breaks my heart and I lose any hope that there are any conservatives left dedicated to God and the Truth.***Because that‚Äôs not the mortality rate you absolute chucklefucks üôÑ

A mortality rate is calculated from how many people got the virus compared to how many people died from the virus.

If he wanted to say ‚Äúdeaths are down by 85%, he‚Äôd be correct. But he didn‚Äôt, meaning the claim is false.***Well, no, but actually yes.

It‚Äôs misleading to straight up say it‚Äôs false.***Also there is no way to account for how many unregistered cases there are. I thought I remember someone from cdc saying it could be 10x as many cases as officially reported due to asymptomatic or mild symptom cases where people get over it and not tested. This could change the death rate if number of cases increased and deaths stay same or even drop (some cases I think may be unrelated to COVID they had it but did it actually contribute to death?)***This claim is false until it is put into context. With the contextual analysis provided we can see that there is actually an overall increase since the beginning of this pandemic in America***He didn‚Äôt say since the height is down 85%***I mean... he was wrong saying it was the mortality rate tho...***BLM ‚úäüèæ = Biden Laptop Matters !!***I don‚Äôt think 17k people died in a week in the us.

Mortality rates are given against a population number. Like 600 per million. Or 60 per 100k.

The percentage of people who contract the disease and die is the *FATALITY* rate. And even then, there is the CFR (Case fatality rate), which measures only lab confirmed cases, and the IFR (Infection fatality rate) which measures based on extrapolated number of total infections, confirmed or not.

Jesus.***Honestly like James O‚ÄôKeefe said, ‚Äúwho checks the fact checkers?‚Äù These fact checkers have a clear political bias, and 99% of the rime their fact checks ARENT fact checks at all, but an assertion that they doublethink somewhere in the middle of the article.

You all are so quick to defend this guy you're not even seeing that it's just a misused term. That's exactly what this is pointing out if you read more than what's got red on it. Not that the numbers are wrong, but what he's calling the numbers isn't anywhere near accurate.

I think we can all agree we would like to get away from using oil at some point, but we are not there yet. I compare it to when the liberals told us to save the planet by using CFL light bulbs. They were expensive, they had shit quality light, and they didn't last long...oh and they were toxic as fuck.

So we all had a big issue with the stupid things and dems called us the usual, saying we hated the planet yada yada yada. Then LED became a thing. And they were great. And they started out very expensive, and became a lot less expensive. I know Obama implemented a policy to phase out old school light bulbs. Maybe that helped, but I also know there was a lot of bullshit in there. After switching to all LEDs in my house, it's not like my power bill has decreased some significant way.(I do like that they last forever)  It's always been about the same for the last 10 years. 

At some point we will get on green energy, the thing is, it's not there yet. Hopefully in the next 10 years we get some type of super solar panel and it will be revolutionary. I'm not sure a light bulb like regulation will work great for an entire energy sector. Maybe I'm wrong and if Biden wins we will find out.

If structured correctly: A green styled plan would perhaps not hurt the oil companies at all. They have an absurd level of infrastructure available, and they have a high level of incredibly skilled employees and engineers. They could literally be a vanguard in the drive towards 21st century technology. And they could probably make bank doing so. 

Their high skilled human labor(welders, metalworkers, concrete specialists, mechanics, etc)  and high payed engineers(mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, meta-material engineers etc), are almost being wasted if the company is not incentivized to develop new high-tech.

I hope Trump considers the same possible concept if he does not lose. It could be world changing.

jgnm4z,"Yeah, I don‚Äôt really know what she was doing. They didn‚Äôt just make MAGA against the rules. They made BLM against the rules too. So they weren‚Äôt playing favorites. They just didn‚Äôt want any political speech or any disruptions I could come from it on their campus. She should lose this one. There‚Äôs a pretty good supreme court president where high schools have the ability to restrict student speech if it‚Äôs going to disrupt the classroom. So that‚Äôs why this district made all political speech, in the form of clothing, against the rules.

Edit: spelling***I certainly don't think it is appropriate for public schools to implement dress codes, particularly those aimed at stifling political speech. But it does seem that they at least were being fair about it, insofar as they explicitly included BLM as an example of what fell afoul of their ban on political messaging.***Well, if the school has a policy on no clothes or flags with political slogans, it is what it is. However, if they have no such policy, and or there‚Äôs kids who wear things like Biden, or BLM clothing etc and have not been suspended(after being warned) there is a problem, and a lawsuit. What is the case?

If they have a policy in place for no political clothing etc. and this rule is enforced towards both sides, this story is a nothingburger and she has no case.

Bothers me so much these people that still don‚Äôt understand ‚Äú1 A and free speech‚Äù do not allow you to do and say whatever you like whenever you want in any setting. It protects you against retribution by the government. 

Ok rephrase: you have extremely limited free speech that work cannot fire you for, and school cannot suspend you for.

The question that needs to be asked, is what exactly CAN they regulate.



Though public school students do possess First Amendment freedoms, the courts allow school officials to regulate certain types of student expression. For example, school officials may prohibit speech that substantially disrupts the school environment or that invades the rights of others. Many courts have held that school officials can restrict student speech that is lewd.

Many state constitutions contain provisions safeguarding free expression. Some state Supreme Courts have interpreted their constitutions to provide greater protection than the federal Constitution. In addition, a few states have adopted laws providing greater protection for freedom of speech.***It‚Äôs a school with a rule against political attire, nothing wrong with that.  They explicitly ban other things like BLM as well so it‚Äôs not an anti-conservative bias, it‚Äôs just a rule meant to stop shit from getting started.***Is the flair thing some kinda of snowflake talk to prevent outside opinions?***The only way this gets thrown out is if the court decides it‚Äôs viewpoint-based; it‚Äôs pretty clear that‚Äôs not the case. Even handed (ie viewpoint-neutral) content-based restrictions that further a compelling government interest are permissible.***Gotta keep it all out of schools. 

I will say this though, the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan and merchandise was brilliant marketing for Trump and his campaign in general. The attacks on people wearing that apparel only galvanized his voter base and shifted a lot of undecideds on his side. The actions of the far left look unAmerican ( i.e. kicking people out of businesses for wearing MAGA gear) 

However parents are an entirely different animal than traditional politics. Teens can't have general immunity from society then engage in things in school that enrage people. The best argument to keep politics out of the workplace ( where it's out of control) is to keep it out of everything else that's considered mandatory ( i.e. we have to work to survive)***That's what I hate about schools.  The laws for them are changed and the constitution no longer applies.  If someone hits you it's not assault. If someone bullies or stalks you, its your fault for defending yourself.  If you wear or say something like your own opinion you are suspended or expelled. Forget saying the word gun or bomb.  Even if it was a bath bomb or a pop tart shaped like a gun.  It's time to return constutional rights and saying the pledge of allegiance.***Well technically the school is doing it's job, and teaching kids what life will be like under the Biden administration so...***Take them for all you can and a written and published apology in the local media.***This will help us win Pennsylvania üëçüèΩ...
People see this tyranny first hand***Too bad the place were our children learn about freedom of speech is a place where you cannot practice freedom of speech***If public education is funded and organized by the government, and the curriculum is determined by the government, and part of their job is to educate/indoctrinate youth about the nation, its history, and its government, then it is an extension of the government and should not be able to restrict free speech. Especially when our history and current events are being viciously politicized by educators.

This version of America is very hostile to anyone conservative, anyone religious, anyone who happens to have white skin, and especially anyone who supports Trump.

Trump will win handily.***That's why you just gotta correct it now bro, save face.

However, the profession needs a complete restart/philosophical shift in how it approaches acquiring information. Especially in this increasingly hostile climate of anything opposing liberal views in the media, social environments and a combination of the two via social media.  

Observing his town hall-style Zoom last night post-debate it appears he was getting real answers, real feedback and real emotions. That's, quite evidently, lacking nowadays in polling. I'm safely assuming far too many in his profession are WAY too deep in the bubble and have lost the ability to separate their view from the view of the registered voter.

The young ones, many are also in typically overtly liberal college/university system, and that's a tough environment to be in while conservative.

But please let me enjoy the glorious knowledge that it was patriotic black Americans that gave Trump four more years over the pandering do-nothing Democrats.  

In return, I promise not to stop laughing and drinking the saltiest tears ever recorded.***Trump really has done a lot to help black folks. He funded HBCU‚Äôs long term, truly invested in their communities, and helped out with prison reform. The democrats could have done all this but never did. I think a lot of black folks on the fence are probably asking themselves, why?***How many will actually vote for Trump though?

He's definitely not getting 40%, but even 20% would be enough for him to win the election.***If this poll is even close to accurate and translates to votes  Dems are fucked.  They‚Äôve relied on the black vote for so long that they don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs possible for their policies to be so extreme that they lose that demographic.

Until then, I'm getting prepared for a Biden/Harris victory while simultaneously planning various boating trips.***(X) Doubt

I'm just trying to be realistic. Were not going to get 46% of the black vote, which is the implication here. This is fake news meant to influence us. To mess with us. 

Vote. Bring 10 of your family/friends to vote. Don't listen to fake polls.***Rasmussen does tend to skew a few points in favor of republicans.  But only 5 or 6 at most.  Worst case, this is actually high 30's, which is still ridiculously high.***I read once back in 2016 that if Republicans ever got even 20% approval with black Americans the dems would be absolutely fucked. Me and my wife have been predicting that this year's _huge_ surprise is going be Trump losing a bit of the white vote but make _absolutely fucking massive_ gains in black and hispanic votes, and it's going to prompt the democrat party to ~~finally introspect what's wrong with their party and realize they've lost Americans and attempt to change~~ completely lose their shit, insult their minority base they lost, and double down while fighting the election results with the fervor of a cornered animal.***The RCP polling average has Trump down about 8% nationwide.  He is down about 5.5% in the battleground states.  If accurate, he will lose.  This poll has Trump approval at 46% among black Americans.  If true, he will win handily.  

Someone is not telling the truth.***Asians: ""Are we dead to you?""***That cannot be correct. 46% of the black vote for a Republican would result in 49 states going red***You can also bet your ass that pollsters are not giving Trump any weighting for black voters above 10%***This is what happens when you continually call someone racist, support the allegation with zero evidence and then go on to say and do truly racist things. And then when black people spend time with conservatives, they realize that we just want a true meritocracy and that it has absolutely nothing to do with what you look like and everything to do with how hard you try and what you have to offer. I am hopeful that Trump is going to be remembered as the man who actually broke racism in this country.***There are tons of young black conservatives out there.

Alienating them in the media only pushes the undecideds and the moderates to the right of the spectrum.***Trump cleaned Biden‚Äôs clock on race

If it is awesome but if not darn lol***Some of that pre-debate momentum has to be fallout from black conservative Philip Anderson protesting big tech and social media censorship and getting his teeth knocked out by white ANTIFA/BLM ‚Äúcounter-protestors‚Äù, which resulted in him being immediately blacklisted from social media so he couldn‚Äôt share his story.

Normalizing hate crimes and then suppressing information about crimes inconvenient to their narrative is a pretty nasty road the left has been barreling down.  And it‚Äôs no longer just the extreme left, it‚Äôs almost the entire media with monolithic corporations and elected politicians joining the fray.

I just feel sad for people who let their hearts be incinerated by anger.***Wait...Ain't the Rasmussen Polls, along with Gallup, legitimately some of the least reliable polls in politics? 

I swear it's something like ""Out of 30 polls, Rasmussen is ranked 27th in terms of facts"".***Wow if true.

I doubt it's anywhere near 46%.

On the other hand, even if this is half-true, 23%, it would be a huge deal.

And on the other other hand, not that I'm the black people whisperer or anything, but I do know that a lot of black people don't like to be pandered to, lied to, patronized, etc. and we've just watched the Dems kneel, wearing their little scarves, say they ain't black if they vote Republican. I know enough black people to know that there's no respect for that kind of thing.

Considering Trump started at likr 10% in the Rasmussen poll 3 years ago, and he has been polling above 30% with them for the last year, and now hits an all time high, the Dems must be in an absolute panic right now.***Is this the first time in history black people have supported a republican candidate this much?***we have the best super predators!***I doubt it's actually 46% but if a poll is even close to being able to get this number then it's surely a high approval rating.

But every Republican candidate for President from Bush in 2000 to McCain 2008 to Romney 2012 has been an establishment, RINO, Republican-lite, NeverTrumper.

Ethan did apologize and deleted the tweet.  People just need to slow their roll and get facts before reacting.***Oh then it's fine lol fuckin nazi losers***I don't really know anything about the podcast in question, but Trump did say ""good"" right?

Also, Obama built those cages that were used to smear Trump and it was never reported how many children went missing under his watch.

You can hear him saying 'go ahead', which seems to be an indication to the moderator instead of addressing Biden.

I will say that he's a damn liar and still needs to address the fact that separating children was a policy decision by his administration, a punitive measure to discourage asylum seekers, but in this instance he did not say 'good'. Debates should be judged on facts and truth, not lies.***I knew someone would catch that.***exactly***I also thought he said ""good"" which seemed weird to me given that he had a pretty solid stance prior to that comment. He did say ""go ahead"", which makes more sense given the timing of the comment.

While I don't agree with that, I think it's telling how often they don't take their own advice. They'll make fun of the working-class, blue collars. They'll make fun of old people. They'll mock religion, something the poorest and most oppressed people in the world cling to.

I know it's a controversial opinion to some people and probably unpopular, but after looking into the details of the lives of some of the biggest names in comedy - they would be considered to be dirtbags if they weren't famous. And this goes for guys I was and am a huge fan of. Don't take your morals from a comedian...it's all a big joke.***He's going to come across the wrong person someday and and it's going to be his last broadcast.***He may be a little irritating recently, but idk he is still funny to me.

What an asshole, to have the solution for the rest of the world and sit on it until we all do something for him.***You know, the *thing;*  C'MON MAN!***He'll use that.. that thing man!!***same guy who says he's going to create 500 million jobs when their is only 384 million people in America. um, what?***Did the Moderator even bother asking how he plans to do that considering his plan is identical to Trumps?

**EDIT:** TomEdwardsMusic commented below and provided insight, I wanted to share for everyone.

> She did, and he explained that he would create a unified national plan to shut down cities when a certain threshold of cases are met. And that, when that happens, the small businesses and individuals affected would receive relief funds. And that when businesses do open back up, he would have national guidelines for opening safely and provide them with the resources to do so. He literally said it right after the quote this post references.

Personally, I‚Äôm all for this idea. Would need to expand the details a bit ‚Äî obviously ‚Äî but I would be very receptive to this kind of threshold approach. I‚Äôm particularly fond of having small businesses and peoples affected receive the relief funds necessary following opening back up. Seems logical to me, step in the right direction for sure.***‚ÄúTrump what have you done to stop the virus‚Äù

No matter what, a group of people will be negatively impacted by new healthcare, and a group will be positively impacted. The key is doing it without turning the lower middle class into more lower class.

Just have a respectable conversation with America like they‚Äôre adults. 

Dear America,
We have a health care issue in this country and there isn‚Äôt an easy solution to it. Currently millions are left without insurance or unable to get it. However medical advances and the research and development for that technology doesn‚Äôt come at a cheap price, this along with lack of competition has sent health care costs spiraling out of control.

Competition is hard to come by, because meeting the FDA and EPA standards to produce drugs in this country is very costly, but we can‚Äôt get rid of them because we can‚Äôt have factories making medication in wooden tanks and steel pipes. So we get a few giant corporations who can hurdle the enormous start up cost of the facilities, let alone the research cost, licensing costs and overhead costs. 

So currently we rely on insurance companies to cover the cost. Thought being that most people aren‚Äôt drawing from insurance until later in life. Large supporting body, small using body. However the uninsured who don‚Äôt and/or can‚Äôt pay, that require medical treatment, force operation costs up for the hospital, who then passes the buck to the insurance companies, who then pass it to you.

Fixing it isn‚Äôt as easy as socialized medicine. As I said in paragraph 1, you just end up making the lower middle class poorer. It **always** happens, when taxes are raised. We need more competition in development and production, we need the hospitals to get paid so they can stop charging $300 for a bandaid. And we need some kind of cap on profits of drugs if we can‚Äôt get more competition. But then companies could just make less product to drive up the cost per unit....see where I‚Äôm going here. Super quick and easy step for the government to seize the means of production. 

I shouldn‚Äôt have taken my adderall so late.***My entire family lost our private insurance because of Obamacare, and we were almost thrown out on the street thanks to how expensive it was.

If you can't pay for care, you do not deserve it!***If the first scenario is how the minimum wage works, meaning making it illegal to sell insulin at a high price, depending on whether insulin is actually costly to make or not, it may cause a shortage of it. It won't be profitable to make and sell insulin, which will make it even more expensive to make since supply will reduce drastically.

If the second scenarios is the government paying for a part of the insulin prices, there may not be a shortage, but the government pays that part of the price with the taxpayer's money so it's still making people pay for it whether they need it or not.

If there is a third scenario in your mind please tell me so I can think this through.


So from my limited knowledge I think the solution for the first problem, is your second scenario (a subsidy). The US gov subsidises industries like oil and gas, farming, etc, which are important economically but don't directly save lives. So we may have to consider why that is and what our prorities are.

A third solution to consider would be use solve the problem identified in scenario 1, wherein insulin is more expensive to make than to sell under your example.

How about a government price wherein a company is awarded a cash bonus for finding ways to produce the needed drug/treatment plan etc at price targets (which is correlated to the award size- kind of like the space x challenge etc). Yes that means tax dollars are being spent but it would be a one time affair as opposed to a long term subsidy.***Another side of this that really isn‚Äôt talked about is that their whole plan was a pyramid scheme to begin with and health costs went way up.***This guy really does need help.

At the time they were really struggling, I'm pretty sure they were making less than 40k/y, and my dad worked landscaping 8am-8pm. I can remember my mom stopping by parking lots to pick up receipts that were thrown out just to get the coupons on the back.

They took away our insurance, and replaced it with a much, *much* more expensive one. My dad went from paying $15 for his diabetes medications, to over $40 dollars, because our plan was taken away. My parents would fight constantly because of the sheer financial stress Obamacare put on us. Luckily, they worked their asses off (more or less literally for my father, after daily 12 hour shifts, he can barely walk anymore) to stay afloat. They borrowed thousands of dollars from my grandparents to make ends meet. 

Once Obama's 2nd term ended, and Trump was in office for a while, much of the stress was gone and they were able to live easier. We have relatively cheaper insurance again, even with my dad going to dialysis every other day for four hours.

I don't fully understand the inner workings of the health insurance industry, but whatever Trump did, it was extremely helpful for my family.***r/politics***That is an outright lie. I personally lost my health insurance, through my employer, because of Obamacare. I was told, by the HR person, that that was the very reason. They weren't going to be able to afford it anymore due to the high premiums due to the requirements of Obamacare. 

I also know other people that lost health insurance because of the wording of the law. I know one person who worked full-time, 40 hours a week, and had health insurance at her job. Once Obamacare came, her work reduced her to 29 hours a week, making her part-time and thus cancelled her benefits. Both of us were without insurance for years, because Obamacare's high deductibles basically made it pointless to have it. Why pay hundreds of dollars a month, only to have still pay for a routine visit because I hadn't satisfied the deductible. It was far cheaper and easier just to go to Emergency Clinics and pay the fee in full.***I wish my premiums had only doubled.  My premiums went from $491 to over $1,600 an increase of over 325%.  No health issues, best rate possible in my state.  My deductible is $14,000.

The ""Affordable"" Health Care Act pays for 100% of your insurance if you are low income.

At $68,000 annual income, for a two person household pays $1600 a month premium for a $14,000 deductible policy.   The annual cost is  $19,200, paid in after tax dollars.  If you need actual medical services, with a $14,000 deductible means you pay $33,200  until the insurance policy pays.

At a $67,000 annual income level, for the same two person household, the Federal government subsidy is $638 per month.   At and after $68,000 there is no subsidy.

Households making $68,000 or more are screwed.   The people are affected are families and they drop medical insurance to afford a house and food.  The media never issues a story about this because saving the ""Affordable"" Health Care act is their goal.  They want to pretend that there is no other way to preserve pre-existing condition requirements.  I had a Democrat tell me anyone making over $68,000 is rich and should be happy to pay premiums.

About 25% of the households in the US fall into this trap:

It shouldn't be difficult to replace bad workers.

Yeah, no. Maybe lazy poor performing government workers wouldn't be such a meme if they could actually get fired for being do nothings.***Thank god fire half the people at the VA***If it was anything like PA when I worked there, it was basically impossible to fire someone.  Instead they took to flirting the line of hostile workplace so you chose to quit on your own accord.  My friend tried to clean up when he was made a supervisor, but he couldn't even get rid of the worst deadbeat who was actually breaking the rules due to the extreme protections they had in place.  If you aren't punching supervisors or stealing, you're basically unfirable.  They'll axe you for a single blink outside of the line with no warning in your first 6 month probationary period though; because they know they're stuck with you after that.***As a government worker, I really hope so.***This is great news.  If you‚Äôve ever worked in government you know exactly why this is great news.

I thought it wasn't a bad scenario.***I know too many shitbags who hold government jobs that are virtually impossible to get fired from and just keep collecting checks***People read the article it‚Äôs only for ‚Äúpolicy making positions‚Äù***They could also put those in jail that steal from the government.

I've been in the government for a while ... mostly active duty and have seen some gs civilians pull some shit. One team I was on, the guy was a very outspoken socialist and the shittiest worker I ever seen. His ""boss"" socialist ... so dude never got bad reviews. 

It goes deep my friends and it'll be a while to clean this shit up.***Good. Fire the democrats who boycotted ACB. That was an outrageous expression and is in no way aligned with American values. Blatant disregard for constitutional practices.***And the greatest bill ever to be passed in 100 years was born.***This makes these people a lot closer to political appointees.

But it's important to have good workers who are willing to do their job. My mother suffers from aphasia and cannot speak and Social Security reps made it very difficult to obtain a letter they send out stating how much she would receive monthly. The apartment she is living at required a one that isn't more than 3 months old and my sister and I had to go through 5 reps to get one that would actually be willing to mail and even fax. Being told that they cannot do send it via fax or that the only way to obtain that letter was to open an online account - which my mom has but was locked out of - and they needed HER to verbally comply when she can't. 

It frustrating and took 2 hours for us just to get someone to get it done. And we've sent document to them as they requested showing we are her Power of Attorney and the previous reps couldn't find.

I live on a state that shares a border with *Canada.* People who don't know it are just politically ignorant, and probably much worse than that.***They should watch that Archer episode that deals with this exactly. They even use the term Coyote several times. I think it was on Season 3 or 4 on the top of my head***Wow!

Like most Americans, I‚Äôll  make my own decision on to vote for. 

Thanks anyway***How is this not common knowledge?? I had no idea there were people who didn‚Äôt know this term***This is another great example of why the Electoral College exists. You get these morons on either side of the coast who have no idea what real life is like in the rest of the country. They have no idea what ICE really does to protect this country. Nor do they fully understand the atrocities committed agaisnt children by these monstrous traffickers.

I grew up in a rural area outside of San Diego in California. My adopted mom fostered many children. It was not uncommon for border patrol show up at 2 a.m. with a pregnant 13 year old who had been assaulted by her smuggler. Our house was often a safe haven for these kids.

Wanna protect the children? BUILD A F***ING WALL. Idiots.***This post just made me depressed.

 Yes, Wiley Coyote brought them over. That's 100% what the president clearly meant. /s If it wasn't obvious.***Dear Democrats, take your lies and bullshit somewhere else \_ We are done playing with you fools.   #AmericaFirst.

The Left can't hide their hate and contempt for Americans or the truth.   Once again we see Democrats gas-lighting, dishonesty and willful ignorance on display.   We all know Trump is talking about human traffickers, smugglers.  How stupid do they think we are... Does anyone really believe these people don't know what a 'Coyote' is?

This right here is why President Trump will win reelection, and deserves too win reelection.  I am a registered independent and put our Country and people before party,  that's why I voted a straight Republican ticket yesterday.  We have to return Trump to the White House with a Republican House and Senate if we ever hope to drain the Washington Swamp/DeepState  and return power to 'We The People'.  Trump is doing that, has been doing that from day one \_ that's why they hate him so much.   If you have not voted then get to the polls and make it happen. Ask your neighbor,  Mom, Dad, brother, or sister if they need a ride and take them with you so they can vote Trump too.  Make it happen.

TRUMP2020 \_ Because no one was elected to do whats best for Illegals, K-Street or google. That's not our job. First we Americans need to do whats right and care for our own.***This is why I founding fathers said that voting comes with a responsibility to be informed on the topics. Anyone with brain cells and google can figure out coyotes is a name given to human traffickers on the Mexican border, but let‚Äôs all think it‚Äôs dogs dropping kids off at the fence***Is webster going to suddenly remove that from the dictionary now....***Some of these idiots have a PHD.

I mean I gotta admit the first time he said ""Coyotes"" I was like what?

Then he said it again and I was like ""that must be a term for something I don't know""

Quick search got me what I needed.  So if a moron like me can figure it out, so can all the Choad's on Twitter***It‚Äôd be nice, on both sides, if people would google before they tweet.***that is a lot of blue check marks***This has got me thinking, is ""coyote"" a relatively unknown term outside of border states? Or is this just ignorance mixed with arrogance (mockingly posting without a quick google first)?***Look at all those blue checkmarks, man.***Oh please, if you don't know what coyotes are you haven't been paying attention at all. Which would help me understand your stance on politics. I live in AK and knew what he was talking  about.***These people and their precious blue check marks. And I‚Äôve never heard of any of them.***And they all have blue check marks...***These are the people telling us how to fix immigration? lol.***The worst part is the smugness with which they're wrong***I would say explain what the term coyote means but why waste your breath explaining what they won't listen to anyways.***Blows my mind they took that literally and can't use context. I wasn't aware of the term ""coyote"" before the debate but it's not hard to put two and two together.***Ok I'm an idiot. Not necessarily an idiot but undereducated. But when I come across a word, term, or abbreviation I don't know or understand I look it up......it's the first thing I do. I don't go acting as if your an idiot for using language I haven't heard, I don't know everything. There are only of new things I'll see or hear and I'll go learn. This is reasonable, (not so)-common sense, this is normal.

But no, Democrats know everything so anyone who knows more than them must be an idiot.***Silly Trump. These guys are all correct. Coyotes don't traffick humons, they chase after road runners. I know this because I saw it on tv. They had an animated documentary on it.***Alternate caption:  These people are voting -- are you?***Leave Chris Pratt alone. Leave Cardi B alone and whatever else lefty righty celebs people wanna argue about.

I mean I‚Äôm a dumb ass but at least I know I‚Äôm a dumb ass and I‚Äôm not gonna pretend I know more about a subject Just because a person I don‚Äôt like speaking about it.***Just a brief glance at list and seeing names like Peri Gilpin and Lexa Doig, this seems more like the death rattles of barely relevant entertainers desperately trying to stretch out their last thirty seconds of fame by delivering ice cold takes to dozens of followers on social media.***Van Lathan I remember that guy he got fired from tmz for attacking a employee. His whole gimmick was to bring race into every video they showed knew that guy was dumb***It's as though they know so LITTLE about what's really going on that they think it's a code language when we speak truth..***Probably the same ones that will get their votes thrown out because they put an 'X' through the box on the ballot versus filling it.***People make me sad in my happy spot all the time lately.

That‚Äôs the reality now that a former business partner of Hunter Biden‚Äôs has come forward to provide the ugly details of the ‚Äúfamily brand.‚Äù Tony Bobulinski, a Navy veteran and institutional investor, has provided the Journal emails and text messages associated with his time as CEO of Sinohawk Holdings, a venture between the Bidens and CEFC China Energy, a Shanghai-based conglomerate. That correspondence corroborates and expands on emails recently published by the New York Post, which says they come from a Hunter laptop.

In a statement, Mr. Bobulinski said he went public because he wants to clear his name, which was contained in those published emails, and because accusations that the information is fake or ‚ÄúRussian disinformation‚Äù are ‚Äúoffensive.‚Äù He attests that all the correspondence he provided is genuine, including documents that suggest Hunter was cashing in on the Biden name and that Joe Biden was involved. Mr. Bobulinski says he was also alarmed by a September report from Sen. Ron Johnson that ‚Äúconnected some dots‚Äù on the CEFC deal, causing him now to believe the Bidens sold out their U.S. partners.

Mr. Bobulinski‚Äôs text messages show he was recruited for the project by James Gilliar, a Hunter associate. Mr. Gilliar explains in a December 2015 text that there will be a deal between the Chinese and ‚Äúone of the most prominent families from the U.S.‚Äù A month later he introduces Rob Walker, also ‚Äúa partner of Biden.‚Äù In March 2016, Mr. Gilliar tells Mr. Bobulinski the Chinese entity is CEFC, which is shaping up to be ‚Äúthe Goldmans of China.‚Äù Mr. Gilliar promises that same month to ‚Äúdevelop‚Äù the terms of a deal ‚Äúwith hunter.‚Äù Note that in 2015-16, Joe Biden was still vice president.
 
As the deal takes shape in 2017, Mr. Bobulinski begins to question what Hunter will contribute besides his name, and worries that he was ‚Äúkicked out of US Navy for cocaine use.‚Äù Mr. Gilliar acknowledges ‚Äúskill sets [sic] missing‚Äù and observes that Hunter ‚Äúhas a few demons.‚Äù He explains that ‚Äúin brand [Hunter is] imperative but right know [sic] he‚Äôs not essential for adding input.‚Äù Mr. Bobulinski writes that he appreciates ‚Äúthe name/leverage being used‚Äù but thinks the economic ‚Äúupside‚Äù should go to the team doing the actual work. Mr. Gilliar reminds him that those on the Chinese side ‚Äúare intelligence so they understand the value added.‚Äù

This dispute almost derails the deal. Hunter is hardly visible through most of the work, until final contract negotiations ramp up in mid-May. He brings in his uncle Jim Biden for a stake. (Mr. Gilliar in a text message soothes Mr. Bobulinski with a promise that Jim‚Äôs addition ‚Äústrengthens our USP‚Äù‚Äîunique selling proposition‚Äî‚Äúto the Chinese as it looks like a truly family business.‚Äù) Hunter in texts and emails wants offices in three U.S. cities, ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù travel budgets, a stipend for Jim Biden, a job for an assistant, and more-frequent distributions of any gains. As for annual pay, he explains in an email that he expects ‚Äúa hell of a lot more than 850‚Äù thousand dollars a year (the amount Mr. Bobulinski, the CEO, is getting), since his ex-wife will take nearly all of it.

Mr. Bobulinksi pushes back, warning Mr. Gilliar in a text that they need to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù Hunter because ‚Äúhe thinks things are going to be his personal piggybank.‚Äù The duo worry about his ‚Äúmental state,‚Äù substance abuse, and his ability to make meetings.

Hunter, in his own angry texts, makes clear that his contribution is his name. He rails at Mr. Bobulinski that the CEFC heads are ‚Äúcoming to be MY partner to be partners with the Bidens.‚Äù He reminds him ‚Äúthat in this instance only one player holds the trump card and that‚Äôs me. May not be fair but it‚Äôs the reality because I‚Äôm the only one putting an entire family legacy on the line.‚Äù Mr. Gilliar privately tells Mr. Bobulinski to show flexibility, since ‚ÄúI know why [CEFC Chairman Ye Jianming] wants the deal and what makes it enormous, It‚Äôs the family name.‚Äù

CEFC was closely entwined with the Chinese government and military until it went bankrupt, following U.S. charges of money laundering. There is no question CEFC was buying Hunter for influence.

Joe Biden claims he has never discussed his son‚Äôs business. Yet a May 2017 ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù document shows Hunter receiving 20% of the equity in the venture and holding another 10% for ‚Äúthe big guy‚Äù‚Äîwho Mr. Bobulinski attests is Joe Biden.

In one text, Hunter says that ‚Äúmy Chairman gave an emphatic NO‚Äù to a version of the deal. Mr. Walker, Hunter‚Äôs partner, explains in a text to Mr. Bobulinski that when Hunter ‚Äúsaid his chairman he was talking about his dad.‚Äù

Mr. Bobulinski‚Äôs texts show he even met with Joe Biden. Mr. Gilliar reminds him in May 2017: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention Joe being involved, it‚Äôs only when u are face to face, I know u know that but they are paranoid.‚Äù Mr. Biden had left office by then, though CEFC was always a suspicious company with ties to a rival government. It would have a been risky for any public figure to deal with it, much less a potential presidential candidate. Mr. Biden was given ample opportunity to deny the authenticity or facts of the Bobulinski information at Thursday‚Äôs debate; he didn‚Äôt.

The deal fell through on the Chinese end in the summer of 2017. CEFC was supposed to supply $10 million; it never arrived. This is where the Johnson report comes in. The Senate report notes that CEFC wired $5 million to a company called Hudson West in August 2017. The report says an associate of CEFC Chairman Ye in September opened a line of credit under Hudson West‚Äôs name, and Hunter, Jim Biden and Jim Biden‚Äôs wife, Sara, were given credit cards associated with the account, and bought items totaling more than $100,000.

The report says Hudson West also sent $4.7 million in ‚Äúconsulting fees‚Äù to Mr. Biden‚Äôs law firm over the course of a year. Mr. Bobulinski suspects Hunter and Jim had found an easier way to cash in on their name, one that didn‚Äôt involve pesky partners and complex deals. He sent a furious text to Jim Biden after the release of the Senate report, accusing Hunter and Jim of ‚Äúlying‚Äù to their partners and secretly taking money from CEFC. The FBI last year subpoenaed Hunter‚Äôs laptop. A call to Hunter Biden‚Äôs attorney was not returned by our deadline.

All of this is news. The press corps that is ignoring it spent four years writing about Donald Trump‚Äôs Moscow business. The correspondence meanwhile blows up Rep. Adam Schiff‚Äôs claim that the Hunter story is Russian ‚Äúdisinformation.‚Äù It raises real concerns about what security risks Hunter might pose for a Biden administration. And it raises questions about Joe Biden‚Äôs involvement.

The former vice president is running on trust and good judgment. The Hunter tale is at best the story of a wayward son and indulgent father. At worst, it is an example of the entire Biden clan cashing in on its name with a U.S. rival. As Mr. Biden refuses to answer questions about this case, voters will have to make up their own minds. But given Hunter‚Äôs exploits in China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and elsewhere, much more is yet to come‚Äîin the next week and a half and potentially in a Biden presidency.

But there are tons of illegal economic migrants from Muslim countries in Africa who are in Israel, and Sudan as is the second largest source of illegal immigration.

Raising minimum wage is such an elementary concept yet here we are.***It was hilarious in the debate when he talked about this, and then a few minutes later talked about bailing out smaller businesses (I think as COVID relief).... and the lack of realizing his own contradictions. Most small businesses can‚Äôt afford $15, so you‚Äôll bail them out from drowning from COVID shutdowns (caused by you) and then force them to pay employees $15 an hour which will just throw them back under.***And Trump‚Äôs response was absolutely correct.

https://twitter.com/rightlynews/status/1314697697711063044***It‚Äôs almost as if making employers pay their people more means they have to spend more money on labor! Which means they won‚Äôt make a profit!***It's too high for some states. Might be fine in others. As trump said cool to raise it a bit where appropriate but not across the board. Let it be a state by state decision***I always enjoy breaking down the math on this question.

Let‚Äôs say a coffee shop is open from 7 am to 8 pm, then their staff probably shows at least 30 minutes early and stays at least 30 minutes after closing. That‚Äôs a 14 hour period of staff working. If they average 4 workers on the clock at all times, then that‚Äôs 56 man hours per day. In NY, I suspect they‚Äôre open 7 days a week. That‚Äôs 392 man hours per week.

If that business is required to increase their pay rate by $2 per hour, that‚Äôs a payroll increase of $784 per week, which is $40,768 per year.

Now if this business was doing well, the owner would probably be paying themselves anywhere from $80-$120,000, since this is NY and living expenses are high. So with this $2/hr pay increase, this small business owner has been forced by the Government (read ‚Äúunder threat of death‚Äù) to give up at best 30% of their income and at worst 50%.

Now you tell me what incentive anyone has under this system to start businesses and employ staff?

For the fun of it, what if that business had 10 locations?  Or 20? Or 50? Take that yearly increase amount and multiply it by the number of stores.

So a chain with 20 locations would be increasing their payroll costs by $815, 360.

Now I‚Äôve known a few business owners, and most of them don‚Äôt cut themselves a salary of $815k. They typically cap themselves at whatever is considered upper-middle or low-upper class and invest any excess in growing the business. So that would be anywhere from $150-$250k per year.

So this new $2/hr increase has cost the company approximately FOUR TIMES the annual salary of the hypothetical owner of this business.

Can you imagine owning a business and suddenly lose $46k a MONTH in profit? These people don‚Äôt realize that they are hurting themselves (well, all of us) with these minimum wage laws. And they say they‚Äôre against big business, CEOs, the mega rich, etc.? Then why do they push so hard for legislation that actually serves to benefit those same entities  by putting their competitors out of business ??

Oh, and this doesn‚Äôt account for the payroll taxes that the employer would have to pay.***‚ÄúBiden gets elected in 2020‚Äù

From his Roughing It, 1872

Along about an hour after breakfast we saw the first prairie dog villages, the first antelope, and the first wolf. If I remember rightly, this latter was the regular coyote (pronounced ky-o-te) of the farther deserts. And if it was, he was not a pretty creature or respectable either, for I got well acquanited with his race afterward, and can speak with confidence.

The coyote is a long, slim, sick and sorry-looking skeleton, with a gray wolfskin stretched over it, a tolerably bushy tail that forever sags down with a despairing expression of forsakenness and misery, a furtive and evil eye, and a long, sharp face, with slightly lifted lip and exposed teeth. He has a general slinking expression all over. The coyote is a living, breathing allegory of Want. He is always hungry. He is always poor, out of luck, and friendless. The meanest creatures despise him, and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede. He is so spirtless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth are pretending a threat, the rest of his face is apologizing for it. And he is so homely! -so scrawny, and ribby, and coarse-haired, and pitiful.

When he sees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out, and then turns a little out of the course he was pursuing, depresses his head a bit, and strikes a long, soft-footed trot through the sagebrush, glancing over his shoulder at you, from time to time, till he is about out of easy pistol range, and then he stops and takes a deliberate survey of you; he will trot fifty yards and stop again- another fifty and stop again; and finally the gray of his gliding body blends with the gray of the sagebrush, and he disappears. All this is when you make no demonstration against him; but if you do, he develops a livelier interest in his journey, and instantly electrifies his heels and puts such a deal of real estate between himself and your weapon that by the time you have raised the hammer you see that you need a Minie rifle, and by the time you have got him in line you need a rifled cannon, and by the time you have ""drawn a bead"" on him you see well enough that nothing but an unusually long-winded streak of lightning could reach him where he is now.

But if you start a swift-footed dog after him, you will enjoy it ever so much- especially if it is a dog that has a good opinion of himself, and has been brought up to think he knows something about speed. The coyote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of his, and every little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his shoulder that will fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and worldly ambition, and make him lay his head still lower to the ground, and stretch his neck further to the front, and pant more fiercely, and stick his tail out straighter behind, and move his furious legs with a yet wilder frenzy, and leave a broader and broader, and higher and denser cloud of desert sand smoking behind him, and marking his long wake across the level plain!

And all this time the dog is only a short twenty feet behind the coyote, and to save the soul of him he cannot understand why it is that he cannot get perceptibly closer; and he begins to get aggravated, and it makes him madder and madder to see how gently the coyote glides along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he grows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully he has been taken in by an entire stranger, and what an ignoble swindle that long, calm, soft-footed trot is; and next he notices that he is getting fagged, and that the coyote actually has to slacken speed a little to keep from running away from him- and then that town dog is mad in earnest, and he begins to strain and weep and swear, and paw the sand higher than ever, and reach for the coyote with concentrated and desperate energy. This ""spurt"" finds him six feet behind the gliding enemy, and two miles from his friends. And then, in the instant that a wild new hope is lighting up his face, the coyote turns and smiles blandly upon him once more, and with a something about it which seems to say: ""Well, I shall have to tear myself away from you, bub- business is business, and it will not do for me to be fooling along this way all day""- and forthwith there is a rushing sound, and the sudden splitting of a long crack through the atmosphere, and behold that dog is solitary and alone in the midst of a vast solitude!

It makes his head swim. He stops, and looks all around; climbs the nearest sand mound, and gazes into the distance; shakes his head reflectively, and then, without a word, he turns and jogs along back to his train, and takes up a humble position under the hindmost wagon, and feels unspeakably mean, and looks ashamed, and hangs his tail at half-mast for a week. And for as much as a year after that, whenever there is a great hue and cry after a coyote, that dog will merely glance in that direction without emotion, and apparently observe to himself, ""I believe I do not wish any of that pie.""

The coyote lives chiefly in the most desolate and forbidding deserts, along with the lizard, the jackass rabbit, and the raven, and gets an uncertain and precarious living, and earns it. He seems to subsist almost wholly on the carcasses of oxen, mules, and horses that have dropped out of emigrant trains and died, and upon windfalls of carrion, and occasional legacies of offal bequeathed to him by white men who have been opulent enough to have something better to butcher than condemned Army bacon.... He does not mind going a hundred miles to breakfast, and a hundred and fifty to dinner, because he is sure to have three or four days between meals, and he can just as well be traveling and looking at the scenery as lying around doing nothing and adding to the burdens of his parents.

We soon learned to recognize the sharp, vicious bark of the coyote as it came across the murky plain at night to disturb our dreams among the mail sacks; and remembering his forlorn aspect and his hard fortune, made shift to wish him the blessed novelty of a long day's good luck and a limitless larder the morrow.***Lol at the libs thinking this is a racist term...it's like saying narcos****human traffickers***Seriously, I'm Canadian and even I know what a coyote is.

There's a reason people are talking about this. Before this point, Mexicans coming into the border would be detained and sent back to Mexico. Instead, this administration separated children from parents. The majority of the children separated were not brought over by ""coyotes"" (aka human traffickers). Even the ones that were shouldn't have been separated from their parents--they should've just been sent back. 

>In the past, most migrants illegally crossing the border came almost entirely from Mexico; however, the current influx now includes **greater numbers of women and children fleeing violence, gang recruitment, and sexual trafficking in the Northern Triangle of Central America countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.** Rather than illegally crossing into the US, they are presenting themselves at the border hoping to **claim asylum, which they were legally entitled to do under certain circumstances**

I hate the MSM.***The original prediction was for over 2million dead in the US. That means Trump saved at least 1.8 million.***Trump has lied quite a bit. So has Biden. Trump is a better public speaker and can do a debate where he minimizes his exposure to immediate and later fact checking.

Politicians lie, that's what they do. Here is where the DNC failed. Biden has 47 years of flip flopping over time to garner votes or political leverage that were good decisions for his career at those specific times, but have come back to haunt him. Trump is not a career politician and so he doesn't have that type of track record against him as a politician.

You'll see this with AOC in the future. Right now, she doesn't have much going against her because she's still too new. People point out the stupid things she says and there are lots of them, but she hasn't had a lot of road to build lies and get outed for corruption. However in ten years, in order to climb up the political ladder, how much blood and filth will she had to wade through to get ahead?

The attacks on Trump are mostly personal for two reasons. First, he doesn't have decades of politics to attack. Second, he invites the brutality. It's why he got so much ink/TV time in 2016 that amounted to about 2 billion in free media coverage. The more the left hates him ( and the MSM makes tons of media by the controversy he creates), the more individuals on the left do things ( like kicking MAGA apparel wearing people out of their businesses) that galvanize Trump's voter base.

He keeps himself at the center of the conversation.

I don't have a problem with people who point out Trump's lies as long as they have a basis in fact. You don't get to be a billionaire by being squeaky clean. I don't get outraged at the MSM open attacks on Trump because it's actually part of his political strategy. The more they attack him, the more moderates and undecideds will lean to the right on the spectrum. Trump is far superior at political theater than these lifelong politicians, which is hilarious in it's own way.

The DNC picked the wrong person. They've done it twice. They like the money that Clinton and Biden can raise for them more than they wanted to pick someone who could actually win. That's their own fault.

Lots of people I know are voting based on an issue the MSM won't discuss. Biden's cognitive decline and his age profile. The system was not designed to allow Harris to become defacto President without actually getting elected. That bothers people. Lots of people. But no one wants to talk about it in the open press. It doesn't matter if it's running against Trump or anyone else, it's a subversion of people's sense of their own integrity. They all know politicians have zero integrity but once you dig into an individual American's integrity about the process, you've lost them forever.

jgv640,"The Senate completed an investigation involving Chinese influence in the 1996 election:  


China channeled donations to US politicians in 1996

By Maxim Kniazkov

The Chinese government launched a covert operation in 1996 in a bid to influence the US political process and gain wide access to officeholders through political donations, a US Senate panel has concluded.

The conclusion is contained in a report quietly released by the Senate Intelligence Committee last week. It went largely unnoticed until Friday, when [the Federation of American Scientists publicized it](http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2001_rpt/srep107-51.html) on its website.

The Senate probe was prompted by allegations that China had tried to funnel 300,000 dollars into the 1996 reelection campaign of former president Bill Clinton through Democratic Party fundraiser Johnny Chung.

The goal of the Senate investigation was to determine whether Chung had acted as part of a concerted effort by Beijing's intelligence services to buy favors with US politicians.

""The answer to that question, the committee concluded, was: Yes,"" the report stated flatly.

According to the document, Chinese officials decided to find a way to rebuild their relations with US politicians in 1995, when the Clinton administration granted an entry visa to then Taiwanese president Lee Tung-hui.

The visit irked Beijing so much that Chinese officials produced what US investigators refer to as the ""China Plan,"" a covert operation designed ""to influence the US political process favorably.""

""The existence of this plan is substantiated by the body of evidence ... including intelligence reports,"" the committee said.

China views Taiwan as a renegade island and vehemently protests even private trips by Taiwanese officials to the United States.

The plan put together by the People's Republic of China (PRC) ""applied to various political office holders or candidates at the local, state, and federal level,"" according to the report.

""There is intelligence information indicating PRC officials provided funds to US political campaigns,"" said the document.

However, the committee found no evidence of any direct Chinese attempt to influence a member of the US Congress. And ""there is no intelligence information indicating that contributions had any influence on US policy or the US political process, or that any recipients knew the contributions were from a foreign source,"" the report said.

Chung told US investigators that Liu Chaoying, daughter of a prominent Chinese general, served as the channel through which he received Chinese government funds destined for the donations -- which, emanating from a foreign government, would be illegal under US law.

China has strongly denied the allegations, and the US Democratic National Committee said any such donations had been returned.

But it now appears that Chung was not the only actor in the game.

""There is also reporting regarding contributions from other sources made to a Republican candidate for state office and a Republican state office holder,"" said the committee.

None of the officials was identified by name.",0.9805,0,0,Positive,"China channeled donations to US politicians in 1996: Activities of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 1999-2000",reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/jgv640/china_channeled_donations_to_us_politicians_in/,10/23/2020,china channeled donations us politicians 1996 activities senate select committee intelligence 1999-2000

Nuclear is failing not because of fear, its failing because its got terrible economics.

Nuclear is an opportunity cost; it actively harms decarbonization given the same investment in wind or solar would offset more CO2


>[""In sum, use of wind, CSP, geothermal, tidal, PV, wave, and hydro to provide electricity for BEVs and HFCVs and, by extension, electricity for the residential, industrial, and commercial sectors, will result in the most benefit among the options considered. The combination of these technologies should be advanced as a solution to global warming, air pollution, and energy security. Coal-CCS and **nuclear offer less benefit thus represent an opportunity cost loss""**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2009/ee/b809990c#!divAbstract)

It is too slow for the timescale we need to decarbonize on.

>[‚ÄúStabilizing the climate is urgent, nuclear power is slow,‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt meets no technical or operational need that low-carbon competitors cannot meet better, cheaper and faster.‚Äù ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nuclear-energy-too-slow-too-expensive-to-save-climate-report-idUSKBN1W909J)

The industry is showing signs of decline in non-totalitarian countries.

>[""We find that an eroding actor base, shrinking opportunities in liberalized electricity markets, the break-up of existing networks, loss of legitimacy, increasing cost and time overruns, and abandoned projects are clear indications of decline. Also, increasingly fierce competition from natural gas, solar PV, wind, and energy-storage technologies speaks against nuclear in the electricity sector. We conclude that, while there might be a future for nuclear in state-controlled ‚Äòniches‚Äô such as Russia or China, new nuclear power plants do not seem likely to become a core element in the struggle against climate change.""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221462962030089X)

Renewable energy is growing faster now than nuclear ever has

>[""Contrary to a persistent myth based on erroneous methods, global data show that renewable electricity adds output and saves carbon faster than nuclear power does or ever has.""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629618300598)

There is no business case for it.

>[""The economic history and financial analyses carried out at DIW Berlin show that nuclear energy has always been unprofitable in the private economy and will remain so in the future. Between 1951 and 2017, none of the 674 nuclear reactors built was done so with private capital under competitive conditions. Large state subsidies were used in the cases where private capital flowed into financing the nuclear industry.... Financial investment calculations confirmed the trend: investing in a new nuclear power plant leads to average losses of around five billion euros.""](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.670581.de/dwr-19-30-1.pdf)

The nuclear industry can't even exist without legal structures that privatize gains and socialize losses.

>[ If the owners and operators of nuclear reactors had to face the full liability of a Fukushima-style nuclear accident or go head-to-head with alternatives in a truly competitive marketplace, unfettered by subsidies, no one would have built a nuclear reactor in the past, no one would build one today, and anyone who owns a reactor would exit the nuclear business as quickly as possible.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2012/03/29/exelons-nuclear-guy-no-new-nukes/#3c8acf0a3c5d)

They claim they are ""compassionate"" but don't even know what horrible things happen to kids who are victims of human trafficking which is made easier by their close proximity to those in the general population who are evil people.***It was interesting how most the Biden lovers enjoyed calling Trump evil for abandoning those 500 kids but when Trump pushed Biden on the cages he just froze up and avoided the question. Idk how people can even act like Trump lost that debate.***Yo stop calling these cages lol they're just cheap detention cells that have walls you can see through to make sure the detainees arent assaulting each other.  That's literally why they are the way they are***Unaccompanied minors. Not to separate minors from family members. She said it right there.***One alternative the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency piloted was the Family Case Management Program, which had 630 asylum-seeker enrollees as of April 2017. In the program, social workers helped participants in five US cities navigate the immigration court system, get housing and health care, and enroll their kids in school. Of those participating, 99 percent attended their immigration hearing and check in requirements and it cost only $36 dollars a day per family. That‚Äôs in contrast to an average cost of $319 a day per person in family immigration detention and $124 a day in adult facilities.

In spite of its great promise as a humane and cost-effective alternative to detention,  the Trump administration yanked the program even paying the contractor an early-termination fee. 

Source: https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/26/false-choice-between-family-separation-and-detention#***Didn‚Äôt the tweet say unaccompanied. That meant without parent? How is that separating?***Love you Jan!***That‚Äôs a lot of damage!***Not being a us citizen living in the us, what I gather from us posts on both end of the spectrum is that you need a system that would be less bipartisan. Today, if you're against something that is supported by both the main parties, who do you vote for? Always voting for the lesser evil and less and less for the greater good seems exhausting. Also, one of the objective of political representation should be... representation. But in such a huge and diverse country as the us, it seems like it's failing. Wouldn't that be an issue that could unite voters regardless of their affiliation? What does this extreme bipartisan system achieve?***There's a difference between unaccompanied children and children forcibly separated from their families.

It's not the cages we have problems with, it's how they are still being used to house hundreds of children the government has no idea where their parents are. 

Accountability that we would demand regardless of administration, hence why the Obama administration stopped using them when there was an outcry.  Which is why the Trump administration had to change the way the laws were being enforced to go back to using them.***Biden voter here! I still don‚Äôt like the idea of cages regardless who built them. Wrong by Obama administration and still wrong by Trump. If trump were a good politician he would have displayed these cages and ran a campaign saying how terrible they are. He would have the Latino vote in the bag. Instead he continued to use them.******Comment graveyard in here. r/degenerateleftpolitics can't handle a little truth I guess.***Didn't Obama and Bush have a catch and release program? Isn't that something Trump campaigned against? Didn't that allow them to release parents and children instead of separating them?

Sorry, y'all can't have it both ways.***Ok so just to recap. We have allegations of corruption against Biden, him lying to the public (Fracking) and now we know he put children in cages while he was VP. Also, Biden has made several racist comments including the now infamous, You Ain‚Äôt Black‚Äù If You Vote For Trump comment and on top of that he oversaw the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act which led to the mass incarceration of African Americans.***Pretty sure they weren‚Äôt meant to separate them though lol***Funny fact about a cage, they‚Äôre never built for just one group. So when the cage is done with them, and you‚Äôre still poor, they‚Äôll come for you.***Fake news***Right, but who‚Äôs *using* them?***So we agree Cages are bad and should go away?

So why isnt trump making them go away?****Unaccompanied children*. As in not kids that are forcibly separated from their parents upon detention. This is not a good hill for conservatives to die on.***Of course Obama built the cages. There needs to be a holding area for people caught at the border crossing illegally while they figure out their status. What‚Äôs different is the amount of arrests and the kind of arrests that filled these cages which isn‚Äôt even close to the same. But hey, who built the cages, right?***Can anyone in here explain to me how Reddit became so incredibly leftist? The front page acts as if there is only one acceptable ideological standing, and that is far left progressive. It‚Äôs so unbelievably bad now.

I just wanna know.. is this really happening? Reddit has to be meddling with the top posts. If Reddit were organic, would the left have taken over? Is it something even worse, like CCP money? I tend to think it‚Äôs a combination of meddling and CCP investment, but I want some insight from Reddit conservatives.****COME ON, MAN!****I feel like most liberals do not comprehend the extent of human sex trafficking of minors in and out of the country. This seems bad on the surface, so instead of cages build what, juvenile detention cells? I think there should be a more humane environment for human children than cages for sure, but then the president would be ‚Äúputting them in jail‚Äù. There‚Äôs no winning with those morons.***Does it matter who built the cages? It‚Äôs not the fact that they are cages that is the problem, but the abuse of detainees. Who cares who built the cage if someone else stuffed too many people in it?******No family separation right ? Cages whatever but 2 year old babies were with their mothers! Even then the cages were only for processing***Democrats sadly learning that their party too doesn't care about illegal immigrants***I don‚Äôt really think this is news, didn‚Äôt everyone know this?***Donald Trump has done more for illegal immigrants than Obama and Biden have done in their corrupt decades in politics. Trump 2020 without a single bit of doubt***What people don't realize is Trump probably didn't know about the cages until the media started blaming him for it. He probably had his feet knocked out from under him and the media kept pelting him for it. Then when he blamed Obama, the media didn't want to listen to him. They believe what they want to believe so long as it makes him look bad. If Trump wins (and I believe he will), the media is going to go nuts!***I would love to see the Democrats try to spin this***Lol laughing at the democrats for such a horrible policy... That the republicans maintained for 4 years?******The thing nobudy talks about was cages were built for UNACCOMPANIED minors. Everyone is getting mad at the us and calling us evil when we get an uncontrollable amount of people at once without proper staffing or infrastructure. Doesn't matter who is the leading the country it's small border patrol stations in remote areas that can properly house 20-300 people. Some locations would get 3,000 new people a day on top of what they already had. Tell me where can you fit the people.  Nobudy mentions that parents of these kids are abandoning their kids at the risk of death/trafficking. I worked a similar job that delt first hand with these issues last year, I won't go into details but trust me the people who work the jobs aren't bad people the media makes em out to be. They are trying to make the best of a shittuwation***The detention cages were built for unaccompanied children, not for the sole purpose of separation of  children from their parents regardless of age, and then willingly not keeping records to reunite families at a later date. There are over 500 children that the Trump administration is unable  to trace and return back to their parents. If you have a parent or a child, just put yourself in that situation. THINK.
I know there is an anti troll thing in this reddit, but without opposing views this reddit is just for right leaning brainwashing purposes.***That‚Äôs just disgusting.  I support protecting them by keeping them detained to find their family later, but those are terrible conditions.***If they built the cages did they use it ? Who used them is what matters ?

 The report is based on over 30,000 pages of documents dated between 2009 and 2014. The documents were obtained by the ACLU Foundation of San Diego & Imperial Counties and the ACLU Foundation of Arizona through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit co-counseled with Cooley LLP. The documents feature numerous cases of shocking violence and abuse against migrant children, many of whom arrived in the United States fleeing violence in their home countries.

* Ran over a 17-year-old with a patrol vehicle and then punched him several times
* Verbally abused detained children, calling them dogs and ‚Äúother ugly things‚Äù
* Denied detained children permission to stand or move freely for days and threatened children who stood up with transfer to solitary confinement in a small, freezing room
* Denied a pregnant minor medical attention when she reported pain, which preceded a stillbirth
* Subjected a 16-year-old girl to a search in which they ‚Äúforcefully spread her legs and touched her private parts so hard that she screamed‚Äù

I‚Äôm not really for socialism all that much. Not many people have really agreed on what implementing it would mean for America, and no one has really agreed on a definition.

I think that the government should definitely give better rights for workers, as well as raise the minimum wage for corporations that make more than say a local business. Some smaller businesses get along just fine and might indeed pay their workers more than the current minimum, but would struggle with and increase in minimum wage. 

Secondly, the value of current day minimum wage is less than it was 50 years ago: [citation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/07/21/adjusted-for-inflation-the-federal-minimum-wage-is-worth-less-than-50-years-ago.html)

Secondly, the price of higher education has steadily been on the rise, making college harder and harder to pay for for most students, who are primarily the people with these minimum wage jobs. [citation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/12/13/cost-of-college-increased-by-more-than-25percent-in-the-last-10-years.html)

[RSA 654:2](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/lxiii/654/654-2.htm) states:

>A domicile for voting purposes acquired by any person in any town shall not be interrupted or lost by a temporary absence therefrom **with the intention of returning thereto as his or her domicile.**

So they get to vote in NH because they moved there to go to school, and they keep their vote even if they leave NH because they intend to return. It doesn't matter why they left.

The author's argument hinges on this:

>That the students in question chose to leave the State shows that they were never actually legitimately domiciled in New Hampshire.

I don't buy that. Possibly before COVID was on anybody's radar they moved to and intended to live in NH for a number of years to complete their school before going home because of COVID (with the intention to return).

I don't really see this as an overreach by the AG. He didn't rewrite anything, it's already written. He's interpreting the law to give people guidance on what to do, which is his job. In this case he's just pointing out that the law clearly allows it.

This shows that future elections will be different.  Putting a token black person on the ballot as your running mate won't be enough for the black vote.  Actually talking to the black community, hearing their real voices and listening to their real concerns and not just listening to BLM is going to determine elections.

They will never occupy the Oval Office again, they will lose influence on the Supreme Court, they will start to lose members in congress as the Republican party becomes the party that doesn't assume it owns the black vote but knows it must work to earn it.  And it is not just the black vote, the Republican Party must do the same with the Latino vote because the Democrats assume they own that vote as well and if the Republicans don't work to earn that vote it will become the Latinx vote: a giant middle finger to a people who use a gendered language by a bunch of racist white people who feel that they know better than you.***'He shouldn't be influencing an entire swath of people who may listen to him because he's worried about his own personal pocketbook,' Handler explained

""Gender is a social construct"". 

""America is racist"".***I think the 2+2=5 narrative is a little simplified when Winston Smith, at the beginning is writing in his sort of journal, he expresses the idea that the objective reality can not be changed hence the irrefutable truth of 2+2=4.

But the reply from O'Brien was not that 2+2=5, his point was that ""Whom who controls the information, controls the objective reality"" So to refute his 2+2=4 mathematical truth he stated that 2+2 =5,6,10,25 whatever they want to.

I've seen this happen with biological sex and how language in the rationale held by leftist ideologues, language doesn't stem as a representation of reality but rather the categorizations are based on \*drum roll\* language, which is indeed moronic.

But the even more shocking truth is that at the end of the book, Winston's spirit was crushed and so he accepted the manufactured reality, seeing that any alternative would have the same outcome in the reality he lived in.***#Thought Crime***I was in a normal level English class freshman year and wasn‚Äôt required to read 1984. I recently bought it but I want to finish my other books before tackling 1984. Any other good reading suggestions that are similar to 1984?



Idk what I‚Äôve been doing the last 4&1/2 years but I haven‚Äôt read it yet.***I started making a list of everything that I was never taught and it just weng absurdly long as well as made me sick. I felt it better to say that much like 1984, the past will soon only be a memory that will either fade away or leaves you questioning if we had truly remembered it correctly if it had happened at all in the first place. The state shall teach us, and to question it is criminal.***When I was growing up, in the south, they only taught the good and left out anything and everything objectionable to America. I imagine most people here are in the same age group and got the same treatment. I can imagine that this  caused a lot of backlash when they finally learned about everything else and instead of them understanding that this is just how history is it causes them to hate America.***And the MSM seal the deal.***Did you read 1984? If you think the current education system even approximates it you probably need to take a step back. Yeah, I do think that pushing liberal points is not a great position for schools but it is far from a state of doublethink. We live in a free country where people can think and say what they feel without persecution from the government. This point is important, persecution from the *government,* not citizens. If people on the street or in a class tell you you're racist or privileged or whatever, this is not the same thing as government-mandated truths.***If a black man can be the one who invented the lightbulb, two and two can make five.

1984 is actually 2028.***Thank God I have no kids.***I went to a Lutheran School from grades 2-8 and when we got to public high school my classmates and I obliterated everyone and skipped the first couple years of math, science, English, geography, social studies, and everything else we were allowed to test out of.

Evolutionary biology was brand new because we previously had no exposure to it, but fortunately it‚Äôs just science fiction with no basis in reality so it‚Äôs just rote memorization and then moving on to actual science that is testable and repeatable.  All the nonsense millions and billions of years people throw out with certainty are just projecting their worldviews on to incomplete evidence.  Ultimately we have no idea when any of this happened, and projecting certainly is disingenuous nonsense.  Academic curiosity has not been a feature of the left for a long time, as they need to feign certainly in their worldviews in favor of any potential challenge to their currently accepted status quo.

You can‚Äôt challenge that assumption. #SCIENCE***Y‚Äôall know that Orwell was a socialist, right? His complaints were mainly about totalitarianism in any form. 

If you block me for saying that, you‚Äôre just doing what you claim to hate. What I wrote above is true.***Read this in high school. Will always be one of my favorite books. 

The left loves it because they see it as prophetic. We love it because it's a warning.***If you best argument for some idea is based upon an anecdote, or a poor comparison. Then your argument isn‚Äôt very good***Incendiary bullshit. Nothing could be further from the truth. I know teachers that are giving it their all and are excellent mentors. Not once have my children been instructed to believe anything blindly. In fact, I‚Äôm beginning to think a lot of adults are just resentful that they didn‚Äôt turn out successful, so they are blaming the education system. No way it‚Äôs your own damn fault. You just have a personal problem with public education that is, more than likely, some petty dispute arising from a delusion. Join the real world and get a life. Help out, or STFU.***Holy hell this isn‚Äôt flaired only yet!

I read 1984 a few months ago. I agree with the author that his first example is shocking and inexcusable. But the thought that kept running through my head when reading 1984 wasn‚Äôt the school system, because examples like denying the holocaust are apparently rare. Rather our current administration‚Äôs constant, incessant often self contradictory lies reminded me of doublespeak (honestly believing two contradictory things regardless of whether either is true).***Repetition makes a fact seem more true, regardless of whether it is or not. It's how Joseph Goebbels convinced millions of Germans to do what they wanted.  ""Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth‚Äù, was a law of Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda and Public Enlightenment and seems a lot like Trump and his administration. Trump repeats things over and over and over again and the base takes the lie as a truth without further investigation.

Liars create the ‚Äòillusion of truth'.***Is this not similar to Trumps new education initiative that wants to glorify America? Sure, there are things that America should be praised for but state mandated patriotism in our history classes seems closer to this than anything I was taught in the my public HS. And I‚Äôm from NY. This is anecdotal, but I remember having healthy debates on whether guns should be in schools, etc in my gov classes, learning the factual history of both capitalism and communism without being told one is the greatest in the world in Econ, etc, no government-approved truth.

Masks are proven to reduce the spread of COVID and are a trivial, low cost measure compared to lock downs.***Branch Covidians.***I am a conservative woman and have worn a mask since February and will continue to.  I may still get COVID.  I may not though.  Why would I want to risk getting it and infecting my family?  We live in a small community and it is hitting us hard here.  Our very small church has been hit.  Mostly by those who haven‚Äôt worn masks.  One lady refused to wear one while her husband did whenever out of the house.  They both got COVID.  He survived, she did not.  She died last night.  She worked in the election office at our court house and worked when she should have been quarantined.  How many people did she infect?  Another lady got up in church and raged about being tired of people telling her what she can and can‚Äôt do.  Where she can and can‚Äôt go.   She refuses to wear a mask at all.  Her daughter, grand daughter and son in law all have it now.  Another family hosted a huge pool party on Father‚Äôs Day and tested positive the following Wednesday.   It goes on and on. 

I don‚Äôt stay at home all the time.  I go get groceries once a week and we go get something to eat once or twice a month.  But we take precautions.  Wear a mask, very frequent hand sanitizing, not touching face, cleaning cell phone and keys, staying a distance from all others, etc. 

This is not causing me any problems.  My 8 year old niece who wears a mask is not being abused.  They are keeping her safe for her two grandmothers to visit who are at high risk.  My mother in law has COPD and emphysema, chronic bronchitis and gets pneumonia every winter.  Her other grandmother has COPD and is immune compromised.  Should they just say ‚Äúto heck with all of this‚Äù and then either never see their moms/grandmothers or risk their lives?  

Don‚Äôt tell me COVID isn‚Äôt real.  Don‚Äôt tell me COVID doesn‚Äôt kill.  We have the deaths in our town to prove it.  The nursing home where I worked for 24 years is struggling hard.  They don‚Äôt have enough staff because of it.  One person trying to do the job of four and she is immune compromised herself having just finished chemotherapy for breast cancer.  That is just one department at the center.  It is wide spread.   Yes, the flu also kills each year.  However, I can count on probably one hand the number of times I coded a cause of death in our facility as the flu.  

I have extremely conservative values in everything except this.  I am pro life, an enthusiastic gun owner, believe marriage is between a woman and man, etc.  But I believe that I CAN CHOOSE to help keep the people I love safe. I also choose to keep the people I may not even like safe.  I don‚Äôt harass people who choose not to wear a mask.  That is their choice and this is mine.

If I must explain this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The whole video is in the frame work of fiction, a dystopian nightmare of one of the founding fathers - right before he signs the constitution.

Just as I prefaced it: ""We as artists, have a unique opportunity to portray and ridicule the absurd to prevent it from becoming reality.

The mask segments are about hypocrisy on the highest level. When the rules are made for you but those who made them are exempt. Pretty much the standard in all dictatorships and totalitarian regimes (I had the displeasure of growing up in one) hence the reference.

I often say, ask us!!! The immigrants... the Cubans, the Venezuelans, the North Koreans, anyone from the former Soviet block... Talk to us and we will tell you .... WE were lucky, because we had a place to escape to. We are fortunate that we could come here.... but If America is gone, where will you go?

We immigrants also remember how our freedom slipped away, how our rights were ripped from us, how we were kept under the thumb and in fear of our own governments. So maybe, just maybe... we have valuable experience we can tell you about, we can forewarn you of the things we have seen before.

So We the people must do everything in our power to stay free as a society. We must prevent the rise of tyranny in all shapes and forms, we must resist the would be dictators and the totalitarian ideals. This is what the founding fathers worried about and tried to prevent by creating the constitution. Believe it. America is a miracle, and I LOVE this country... and I will never shut up about it üá∫üá∏

The article is the one that said he's move out of America specifically.

It's also a fact that the viral load you are exposed to can determine how badly ill you get. So if you wear a mask, and everyone else does too, you may end up absorbing only 50% or 40% of the virus, and develop a mild case versus something worse.

I honestly don't understand this backlash against masks. I agree, the government shouldn't force stuff on people, but I think this is something we should all do voluntarily. It's not that bad really.

In the Duke health care system as soon as they adopted a dual masking strategy, they virtually stopped the in-hospital transmission of Covid.  Look at the graph on the last page of this study--it just could not be any clearer that wearing masks reduces the spread of Covid.

Right now conservatives are under attack like never before and there are so many critical issues that we need to fight on.  It greatly saddens me that many conservatives have chosen to fight masks--despite the science showing they work.  Let's focus our energy on all of the real battles before us, such as: media bias, political correctness, the Biden tax plan, Kamala Harris's goal of making the entire country just like California, corruption in politics, the politicization of the pandemic, etc.***Didn‚Äôt the CDC publish a study that found 70% of positive COVID patients reported always wearing a mask?***Trust the science, but not *that* science.***A journalist is unwilling to relay the facts?!

‚ÄúIt is compassionate to provide reasonable accommodation to assist people born with various disorders to more easily enjoy daily life, but we do not insist on a universal change that affects everyone in order to achieve it. Only transgender activists seem to feel entitled to impose their worldview onto the rest of society.

Besides the common-sense understanding that the overwhelming majority of people are born with an obvious and functioning biological sex, it is equally as obvious to note the medical importance of sex designation. Men and women have strikingly different health-care needs and proper medical distinction can be life-saving.

As Wesley J. Smith noted in a National Review article on this topic, ‚ÄúPublishing ideological advocacy in what is supposed to be a journal that primarily publishes objective scientific information contributes to the growing public distrust of the science sector.‚Äù It is OK to say no to this kind of nonsense.‚Äù

I like that the author allows for a compassionate approach with those who experience life differently than I do. However, ignoring biological realities can too easily lead to problems for people in healthcare.***‚ÄòWhy do you care what people identify as?? Why does it matter to you? Get a life!‚Äô

‚ÄòAlso, we need to abolish the concept of gender in language and medicine.‚Äô

‚Äòpps. It‚Äôs now a criminal offence to misgender‚Äô

Losing the battle over social issues has consequences.***this is a simple solution. Trans people can do what they want, when they are 18 and legally adults. They are free to live their life however they like. I would be fine promoting the use of more gender nutral family bathrooms (which would be 99.99% used by families with kids, which is the ACTUAL need for them)

If a trans person threatens another people, if they try to compel anyones speech, if they insult, denigrate, or slander anyone, then we sue them. Being trans does not excuse you from slander and libel laws and does not give you the right to inflict emotional or financial distress on other people. If you try, you get sued.***Is sex is ‚Äúassigned‚Äù at birth, does that mean race is ‚Äúassigned‚Äù as well?***Sex is more biologically relevant than race.  Therefore, if we do away with sex as a descriptor, we should naturally do away with racial identity.

Science... sick...  Covid... this virus... infected people with comorbidities


Science... brainwashed... bad information... Global Warming... climate change activists***It seems easier if you just define sex and gender differently. EG declare whatever gender you want and makes you feel okay with the world. Sex is a scientific term designed for how hormones, biology, and reproductive organs work. It's really seems like a silly non-issue if people just define their terms.***next just we won't say on driver's license then because I've seen many people's drivers license but hardly anyone's birth certificate 

So if a person goes to the hospital, is it a hernia a pregnancy, appendicitis, cramps? Who knows? It's just a person going to the hospital as a man versus going to the hospital as a woman, they're exactly the same, correct?

Never mind the studies that show bias against women or men of color or even women versus men and pain levels...

There's no need for a doctor to know if you are a man or a woman! 
/s***Sex is a matter of biology.  Gender is a social construct.  While they are often interchanged they have different meanings.  Sex is a boy or girl, gender can be fluid if so chosen, a state of mind.  Personally, I think it is sick and perverse.  Call me transphobic, that's okay.  I don't mind what I'm called anymore anyway,  Frankly I think the whole LGBTQ+++ should just be ignored.  Let them do what they want to do, let straight people do what they are going to do and no more of the whole mess.  Who really cares what they identify with.  A birth certificate, a passport are significant documents and should be left alone.  You come into this world with a sex and you go out that way weather you've had a reassignment or not.  I think the whole thing is really attention seeking.***In Wisconsin we are forced to fund the medically unnecessary transition surgeries of crazy people who work for the state.***Jesus christ, we should never remove male/female from medicine. If worst comes to worst, just use XX or XY***On one hand biological sex is an important thing to know in health care.

On the other hand who gives a shit? Like when was the last time your doctor asked to see your birth certificate in order to get care? Absolutely none of them.

kmhe54,"***Imagine Anerica-First policy, with responsible rhetoric***I'm all for right wing populism but I don't think a multi-billionaire whom we're not allowed question should be the standard bearer for the party, let alone the country. Trump was right that Americans are getting screwed over hard, and they're getting screwed over the most by these giant corporations that can lobby the government for whatever they need. We are no longer a country of ""We the People"" we instead are a country of ""We the Corporations"". Both sides, Republican and Democrat, are both completely guilty of this. We need ground up political change like Bernie, AOC, any right wing version of them, to take our country back. The thing that allows Democrats the wins they get is they do genuinely have people who are in touch with the average American, can you name one Republican that had to actually live the rough life that most of us live?

But he is a compulsive liar who made anything up to protect his ego and image. 
The republicans need a politician that will work on educating the public on the need to create a stable economy, clean up and organize the thousands of messy government programs and actually tackle the deficit. Which is now a bigger problem than ever with the latest stimulus packages. 

Democrats will continue to spend as they are afraid to cut any of their troublesome programs and replace them with actual beneficial ones. I tend to vote left but I‚Äôm afraid they really will run our economy into the ground.***I am not a conservative and disagree with many of Trump's policies, like the use of tariffs and deregulation of businesses at the cost of the environment/consumer protections. However, I appreciated Trump's general aversion to international military engagement (despite his aggressive bluster). The stock market performed well under his presidency, which was beneficial to me personally as a small-time investor.

I didn't like his ""build a wall,"" anti-muslim approach to limiting immigration and his erratic policymaking was unsettling. I feel the confrontational tone he set in the country was domestically destabilizing and was a big part of what led to the summer's unrest. It was embarrassing to have a president constantly tweeting insults at celebrities and getting into tiffs instead of being focused on policy solutions to real problems faced by Americans.

Populists do well. Trump's brand of populism hit a lot of points with people and even with me, a moderate democrat. Unfortunately, it seemed that he didn't understand the mechanisms of government well enough to enact his big ideas, and that the data shows that the divide between the rich and the poor just got wider under his presidency, just like all other presidents. He could have been a great president, and would have likely won even more states than he did in 2016 if he was more of a statesman. 

I just don't think you can be an effective leader when you are literally calling everyone who disagrees with you pigs, idiots, morons, etc. He was just such a loudmouth, and never seemed to really consider what he was talking about (this Section 230 stuff illustrates that right now), it was exhausting to have him in charge. Some people loved it, and he fired up the base, but a lot of times it felt like we'd elected the bully from a 1980s teen comedy to be our president, just loud and thoughtless and needlessly crude.

**‚ÄùUnless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH! Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don‚Äôt let Big Tech steal our Country, and don‚Äôt let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!‚Äù**

https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1343998076084748288?s=21***Surprise said no one***Looks like the defense bill is fillibustered then.***The Republican party is already back to its old ways: willing to run any amount of deficit for the rich but none for its middle class.  They haven't learned anything from Trump winning the primaries.***These articles are crap and there is a lot of misinformation here. Here's the deal:

**What this particular bill is:**  

This is an amendment to the omnibus appropriations bill that the president signed into law last week - that will increase the amount of individual covid relief from $600 per person to $2,000 per person. It is a ""clean"" bill containing only that provision: it simply swaps out ""$600"" for ""$2,000"" in the text of the Appropriations bill. If the amendment had been/is approved, it does not mean that everyone gets $2k. It means that it becomes part of the Appropriations bill, and *then* everyone gets $2k.   

**Background:** 

In order for a bill or amendment to come up for a vote, it has to go through a whole senatorial process. The Majority Leader is generally in charge of the senate calendar and decides what bills come to the floor after they have gone through those processes. There is a shortcut, though: a senator can ask for, and the senate can vote for, a bill or amendment to be brought to the floor bypassing the usual procedures. In order for that bill to bypass the procedures, the vote has to pass *unanimously*.  

**What happened here:** 

1. Schumer asked for the unanimous vote to allow the $2k relief check bill to bypass the procedures and be brought to the floor for a regular vote right away so it could be added to the appropriations.  
2. McConnell blocked that unanimous vote.   
3. Sanders then asked for the unanimous vote to be on bringing the $2k relief bill to the floor tomorrow right after the override vote for the NDAA - the defense spending bill that the president vetoed.  
4. McConnell objected to that as well. These are the blocks these headlines are referring to.  

**If the unanimous vote had happened:**

*...And failed.....*

The bill simply wouldn't have been able to ""skip the line"". It would NOT have been a dead amendment.  

...*And passed....*

The bill would have been able to ""skip the line"" and the senate would have been able to vote on it today (Schumer's motion) or tomorrow after the NDAA vote (Sanders' motion). It does NOT mean the bill itself would be passed, unless of course the second, non-unanimous vote passed.   

**What happens next:**  

The senate is scheduled to vote tomorrow afternoon on the NDAA in order to override the president's veto of it. Sanders has threatened to filibuster the NDAA veto override vote if they don't commit to bringing the $2k relief bill to the floor. The $2k relief bill is not currently scheduled for a vote, and Senator McConnell has indicated that he intends for a relief bill to include the presidents' election fraud and Section 230 priorities as well. He said he intends for the senate to begin work on these things together this week.  

This is why the president just tweeted about those three things - he has tied the Election Fraud and Section 230 issues directly to the $2k relief. 

**What it means:**

This means that unless the senate somehow overrides Trump's and McConnell's wishes, or agrees to a compromise to overcome Sanders' filibuster of the NDAA, the $2k relief will not be coming unless it is bundled with Election Fraud and Section 230 legislation.  

ETA: I corrected the bill name.***Wow he‚Äôs really not helping the Georgia races 600 is a joke and people know it***I have a question that hasn't been answered yet. Will the $600 checks be sent out right away and then $1,400 if this is approved or does this have to be approved first before anything goes out?

People like him and Pelosi deserve bad things to happen to them.***Here's an unpopular opinion, increasing the check without cutting the bloat is going to cost us all in the long, and as far as buying power goes we've lost more than the stimulus check is giving back this year due to inflation. Eventually, we need to understand we can't eat money and stimulus checks but nothing if we inflate the dollar into worthlessness.

However, I don't side with Mitch McConnell either, because there is no solution unless the vast majority of the American people stand up to our politicians and tell them no they can't inflate us out of debt anymore and spending will be brought harshly under control and Americans are just going to have to go child turkey in our dependency in the government for a few generations and look out for themselves. Since that'll never happen though, might as well have some laughs before it all burns.***McConnell, before Senate adjournment, started the Rule 14 process to get 2 bills onto the calendar - the House-passed $2,000 bill and:

The problem with the position of saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôll approve $2,000 if you cut out the pork‚Äù is that Republicans already agreed to that pork. 

It implies that they cared more about pork barrel spending than struggling Americans initially. If the original choice was $2,000 checks OR pork spending, they shouldn‚Äôt have agreed to pork. 

They should have said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sending $2,000 checks, but the total Bill isn‚Äôt going over X number of dollars. Cut out whatever you have to in order to make it work‚Äù. That would have put the heat back on the left to actually reduce spending in order to help Americans.

That‚Äôs basically how I read this Bill.***Giving the president what he wanted.

I hope it works***I wonder how much the tech companies are paying him***The most upvoted comments are the ones complaining about them being tied together.

But I thought we wanted section 230 reformed to protect free speech just a minute ago? I guess when it comes between freedom of speech and an extra $1400, some want the latter.

I understand that many people are in tough spots right now. However, if we do not try this now, we probably won't have a chance to for another decade, if ever. The extra $1400 can wait if it means even just trying to protect our freedoms.

EDIT: keyword reformed. Not repealed. Trump has both said he wants to repeal it, and remove ""protections for big tech"", so I don't know what's in the bill. Regardless, I don't want it repealed. I want it reformed. Specifically Section 230(c)2.

And in hindsight, it was wrong of me to accuse that people just wanted the money. I apologize for that.***Big tech should be liable and if there‚Äôs nothing to hide the fraud panel should be no problem to pass.***Who wants to bet that the MSM blames him when the Dems kill this bill, while turning a blind eye to the liberal pork in the first package. üôÑ***There you go smug leftists, what do you care more about, big tech or big checks?***I honestly don't support untargeted relief checks. I know its anecdotal but most people I know never stopped working and spent the first round of checks on luxuries or credit cards or w/e. Extend unemployment benefits and let people apply for extra aid if they need it. This spending is likely going to have serious repercussions and if it doesn't then it shows us govt is overfunded and federal taxes in all forms ought to drop significantly.***Limiting the immunity of big tech is critical. We should wholeheartedly support this***They should pass a $2k bill with a ban on lockdowns and legal mandates for masks and distancing.  Let business owners decide how to handle the Wuhan Flu.

Edit: this is a compliment you fucking idiots***Everyone negotiated in earnest the $600.00 bill tied to the spending Bill including President Trump who forwarded over all of his budget requests that included a small amount of foreign aid that he‚Äôs now railing about.  If President Trump had a problem with the bill he could have spoken up at anytime during the process. The only reason he‚Äôs doing this is to hurt Republicans on his way out the door.  

So now President Trump and the socialist wing of the Democratic Party are coming back to the table and Mitch is going to get something in return which is why the bill is structured this way.

You would think the Trump wing of the party would appreciate more funds going into election security and the revocation of big tech protections unless of course it was just about President Trump winning the election.***What is going on in this sub?

**Section 230 is what they use to systematically shut conservative voices out, and radicalize our children, our wives, and protects those who outright shit on our religious freedoms.** They use it in order to keep us from having a seat at the table, promote liberal ideology, while shutting us out. It's a clear and evil threat to democracy.

It's the clearest danger to our democracy to ever exist in my opinion. Social media is spoon feeding people liberal lies, and indoctrinating them by playing on their emotions. They have no basis in fact, and the scary thing is, it's working. If 230 isn't repealed or replaced, you can say goodbye to existing as a conservative. There will be nothing left to conserve.

**Hardcore, partisan liberals are in charge of systems like Facebook's ""Tasks"" platform. They stop us from trending, they stop us from being promoted, in the feeds. They don't allow discourse.

> Authorities concluded that 63-year-old Anthony Quinn Warner (January 17, 1957 ‚Äì December 25, 2020), a longtime resident of Nashville,[46][47][48] was the bomber, that he had died during the bombing, and that there was no indication anyone else was involved.[1][40][49] The FBI is probing Warner's motive.[2]

Seems they are pretty insistent he was working alone and died right there.

Under aftermath

> On December 27, a section of¬†U.S. Highway 231¬†in nearby¬†Wilson County, Tennessee¬†was shut down due to a¬†box truck¬†""playing audio similar to [that of] the Christmas explosion"". The truck travelled north from the¬†Walterhill¬†community in¬†Rutherford County¬†along Highway 231 until being pulled over. The driver was apprehended by authorities, and no explosives were found.[68]¬†The driver has since been charged for filing a false report and tampering with evidence.[69]

It‚Äôs unbelievable. It also drives the prices up dramatically. I‚Äôve never understood how this one market was able to operate this way.***The word provider bothers me.
Do they mean hospital or physician?  Because provider is often used to refer to physicians.
Physicians usually don‚Äôt set their prices the hospitals do.***So I work in insurance, billing, claims etc for a physical therapy company. We verify patients insurance and get the estimated amount to be collected but benefits are never guaranteed until AFTER claims have processed aka it‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs not necessarily the healthcare providers who are dishonest, we‚Äôre doing what we can but it‚Äôs the insurance companies that are responsible for the dishonest pricing. If this executive order can fix that for the insurance companies great, but i don‚Äôt see how that can happen***Wasnt this (supposed to be?) part of the ACA?

And how is this different than the EOBs that are currently sent detailing the charge, the negotiated rate, and the patient responsibility?

Also, as an EO, how can this be enforced?***We have a mostly private capitalist healthcare system designed to turn a profit, their services and prices should be disclosed and invoices not dropped on people as a surprise/mystery bankruptcy bomb months after treatment from providers you never laid eyes on. If we run hospitals like a marketplace, all the pricing should be available before we walk in the door. The end cost will not be predictable based on the nature of diagnosis/discovery and treatments, but ALL billable items should be public to inspect before hand (like a huge ass menu), along with estimated total procedure/treatment costs for x affliction.

This is a good first step, but it needs to go further because providers will refuse to comply with it in any meaningful way. Only the barest and most difficult to acquire and least accurate price disclosures will be available and only after a lot of sweat and headache according to what health care provider's legal teams think they can get away with.

If I need simply need a questionable bit of skin removed I would like to be able to choose the cheapest place to get it done (other than doing it in my own kitchen). If I need a lung transplant, I would likely want something on the opposite side of the spectrum. In either case I want the ability to do my homework.***I am a doctor.  Its important to note that It‚Äôs primarily a hospital issue.  We don‚Äôt set prices for any of our procedures - this is decided upon by Medicare and private insurance.  

What we are paid for each procedure, hospital consult, etc - is pretty much set and the same across any particular region. 

Hospital fees are three great unknown.

Here is an example - I have a friend who is an OBGYN.  Regardless, she gets paid the same for each delivery.  However, one hospital charges 18,000 (per-insurance) for a delivery.  The other one in town is 30,000.

This is not the doctor‚Äôs fault. This is a hospital issue.  This is a great job done by Trump and I support it!***I work for a hospital company on the insurance collections side.

Greedy giant mega health systems (created in response to ACA), not the actual Doctor providing your care.***Possibly the best thing that could happen to our healthcare system.***I DON'T THINK I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THE THINGS I USE COST OR WHERE/HOW MY TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT!

- Idiots reporting this thread***Another notch in Trumps long belt of accomplishments that normies have never and probably will never hear about.***I kind of resent the title of this post. ""Greedy"" healthcare providers?  Healthcare providers are not the problem here. The insurance companies are the problem. This executive order will open a whole new host of problems. I can't explain everything in a post but I'll try.

I was the COO of a mobile anesthesia company for 12 years. It's a VERY small company in that the president of the company still does anesthesia frequently, nearly every day, and there are probably 75 other anesthesia providers employed by the company with about 300 clients in 5 states. In the time I was with the company (which I helped found), I saw reimbursements fall steadily until obamacare came into being, and then they fell precipitously. 

Now imagine that your job, whatever it may be, decided that you would not be paid for the work you do today until three, or maybe six, or maybe nine months from now. And when you do finally receive your check, they have cut it by 70%, paying you about 30 cents for every dollar you made. How in the world are you supposed to pay for your living expenses? And then you realize that you still have to pay taxes on the pathetic amount they have paid you. This is what healthcare is like today. They are barely recouping the actual cost of supplies, let alone expertise. Anesthesia is billed in 15 minute increments and it's a flat rate for each 15 minute increment - although the rate varies by the area because living costs vary by the area. Modifiers can be added on, such as obesity, difficult airway (like a very short neck or a very small mouth or both on an obese patient), prone position, etc. However, there are many situations where charging for supplies is verboten. Even in surgery, most supplies are bundled with the procedure.  The only things that MAY be charged for are unusual items such as pins, plates, screws, anchors, or other implants. And most of the time the facility does not recoup the total cost.  What it all boils down to is this:  The margins in healthcare are RAZOR thin.

Meanwhile, absolutely ANYTHING you purchase that is ""medical grade"" costs approximately 50-100 times what it costs to make. A carton of 100 10cc syringes costs approximately $50, with two pieces of nylon plastic and a silicone stopper. The item can't cost more than a few pennies to manufacture. A ""medical grade"" length of dissolvable suture infused with antibiotic that can be placed in the nasal passages after sinus surgery to keep the passages open and to slowly infuse antibiotics to prevent infection (something so small you could easily hold twenty in the palm of your hand - and I know it sounds fancy but it's really not) costs $3000 for a box of 5. I'm just thinking of things that are everyday items that I use in my current job as a charge nurse in a 4-OR surgery center.  All supplies that are used in a legitimate, accredited medical facility have to be medical grade or the facility won't get their coveted Joint Commission accreditation - which you have to have in order to receive reimbursement from many insurance companies, even though The Joint Commission (or you may know it by its old name, JCAHO) is a made-up, privately-owned company that some genius started in 1951, suspiciously when everything began to go south. This accreditation is repeated every three years (if you're lucky, sometimes it's less time) and costs anywhere from $20,000-$100,000 to attain - money that goes directly to TJC. 

Now you have to understand that in every area of the country, just like everything else, there are differences in cost of living. That means that something that costs a lot in Chicago may be cheaper in Kankakee or Peoria or Springfield. And would probably cost a lot more in Los Angeles or New York City. As our Democratic healthcare provider posted elsewhere in this thread,  the hospital (or any other healthcare facility) must charge the ""lowest known price"" which is why prices were confidential. Now you're asking an overstretched healthcare system to provide care at possibly half or less of the cost of supplies/expertise/personnel. Because the ""lowest known price"" will be some backwoods facility in Timbuktu and this exec order will force everyone to provide at that amount, which won't pay for anything.

So what happens? Healthcare quality decreases. Here in the US we have the best healthcare in the world. Say what you want about the costs and the overcrowding and the errors. If you think the errors are bad now, wait until the ramifications of this order materialize. Believe me, the little people at the hospital (nurses, doctors - yes, doctors! - and other ancillary staff) are the ones who will suffer, as well as the patients. No pay raises, benefits cut, less time off, short staffed, overworked. And this is where mistakes happen, which affects all of us. This applies to everyone in the system from the chief surgeon to the tiniest patient - all except the overfed, overpaid, overly important administrators and the insurance companies. Where I work now, there are layers upon layers of administrators. No one is really sure what they're all doing, but they're there, sucking up hundreds of thousands in salaries, benefits, and perks. Look around and tell me if your little community hospital hasn't been bought up by some giant healthcare conglomerate like Amita, Advocate, or whatever the big company is in your area. In fact, look up the top ten or top twenty ""biggest"" (aka richest) healthcare companies in the US. 

They're all insurance companies. 

The country never needed healthcare reform. It needed and still needs health *insurance* reform. The insurance companies are the only ones making any money right now. Take a look upwards in any big city. All the biggest skyscrapers are named for insurance companies.

‚ÄúAt this very moment at a polling location in the county, not only do we have access through the devices to the poll pad, the system, but WE ARE IN,‚Äù Pulitzer said.

He continued: ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not supposed to have WiFi and that‚Äôs not supposed to be able to happen so we‚Äôve documented now it‚Äôs communicating two ways in real time, meaning it‚Äôs receiving data and sending data ‚Äî should never happen, shouldn‚Äôt be WiFi, we‚Äôve now documented it in real time.‚Äù

Georgia‚Äôs Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Elections and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee held the hearing to study Georgia‚Äôs Election Laws and the numerous voting irregularities in the 2020 presidential election.

Pulitzer also revealed differences between ballots printed for Democrat precincts versus Republican precincts, which he said caused GOP votes to get kicked out by the Dominion Voting Systems machines.

Pulitzer confirmed that the system tabulating votes in the two Senate runoffs in Georgia is connected to the Internet.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going on right there where everyone is voting [in the Georgia runoff],‚Äù he said.

Pulitzer said: ‚ÄúI have no regard for the smoking mirrors of how the machines work, the hidden stuff in the code, or how this machine is supposed to be programmed. If the machine worked according to programming none of us would be standing here. We‚Äôre here because something broke.

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm saying ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care about the machine‚Äô. I don‚Äôt even care about the code that was written in the machine. What I care about is that physical artifact. And you know what? That physical artifact has material differences from district to district that should not be there ‚Ä¶ why are they there?‚Äù

Pulitzer said the people of Georgia trusted state officials to ensure the election was valid and fraud free. The current election results are flawed, he said: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the beating of a drum, this is the burning of a city.‚Äù***Why in the hell are they still using Dominion machines?

""the study points to a problem of underreporting in infections during the height of the outbreak in Wuhan, partly due to the chaos at the time and a failure to include asymptomatic cases in the official count of confirmed cases."". 

This isn't lying or trying to cover it up. It is the Chinese government openly and officially stating their count of confirmed cases is low.

But, it is a poll, and polls are mostly made up, so who knows.***We‚Äôll see how much of a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äú you can tote when Biden‚Äôs re-election gets 95% of the vote***You can find the moles with flairs in this post by finding those that support not voting in this election and view their comment and post history.

This subreddit is not only constantly brigaded and shilled but it's has a lot of liberals with fake accounts spouting nonsense.

Vote if you live in Georgia. Not happy about the Republican reps who are not fighting for election integrity? Primary the shit out of them when they come up for election. Replace the RINOs with actual conservatives. Replacing the RINOs with the far left is suicide for our country.

Don't give away liberty and the republic to the blue haired alphabet Marxist people.***Hand the Senate over to Schumer because McConnell and the establishment GOP are useless. That makes sense. 

That‚Äôs like disliking your crappy 20 year old car, so you decide to slam it into a telephone poll without having car insurance.***If they say it enough it might become 1/4th true.***You would have to be pretty retarded to do that. Even if you believed fraud gave Biden the election there, it was only able to do so due to the election being close. Refusing to vote is the most moronic thing you could do.***Trump has asked for two things: to vote in the runoffs and attend the rally on the 6th***First of all, go vote.  If you're hanging on a ledge with one hand, you should try to get a grip with the other, no matter how difficult it might seem, instead of simply letting go and falling to your death.

Secondly, if we lose Georgia, it will be due to Georgia state Republicans refusing to secure the election.  They could have passed anything they wanted to help with election security, and they did nothing.  In fact, they made it worse in some cases.

There's no reason why mail-in voting wasn't severely restricted after the shit show that was the general election.  They could have restricted it to the military and the (provably) infirm and locked out the Democrat's primary means of cheating.

If you can pop champagne at your ""Trump lost"" street party, you can vote in person.***I wholeheartedly believe this poll is misinformation designed to lower the morale of conservatives***So, IF (big if) this is accurate, why in the world would ANY conservative skip out on this after what just happened in early November?  I don't know about you, but I am upset.  I am fired up about this situation, and I hate being cheated.  The only thing we *can* do is act right now.***I doubt this is true. GOP voting is matching or exceeding in early voting. People need to stop making this a thing, it's not a thing.***The Senate GOP just decided that we have money to send to Pakistan for gender programs, but none for taxpayers who were forced out of work get less than a month‚Äôs rent. 

Ossoff and Warlock are horrible candidates and will make horrible senators, but a vote for Purdue/Loeffler is a vote for Mitch ‚Äúmultimillionaire married to Chinese Communist‚Äù McConnell, who just had his ‚Äúlet them eat cake‚Äù moment.***Don't get gaslighted by this, it's clearly a push poll intended to undermine morale on our side or trigger some sort of circular firing squad among Republicans.

As an example, look at the general election back on Nov 3rd: there were these ridiculous ""Biden+17/+11 in WI/FL"" polls  which were clearly intended to prompt low propensity Trump voters to stay at home and sit out the election which allegedly was all over anyway. Except that it wasn't, and that the MAGA vote materialized big time.


This SurveyUSA poll follows the same principle: show conservatives a poll result which would be maximally strategically bad for them. This time, the angle is different, the idea is to cause Republican candidates and strategists to panic and blunder. This poll clearly tries to prompt Republicans to push for ridiculous policies or further infighting (e.g. Perdue/Loeffler vs Raffensperger/Kemp), both of  which poll horribly in the suburbs, in the hopes of fixing a mirage problem.

We must not lose our calm in this crucial moment, the base will show up in the end if we keep our ranks closed and campaign as hard as we can. Going full nutter to ""shore up the base"" is what Democratic strategists want us to do.***or is this just a demlefty 'news' plant to be able to justify a  second rigged election ???

- Scandals about breaking her own lockdowns to buy expensive jewelry

- Stabbing the restaurant industry in the back over and over by lying to them about when they can reopen. 
 
- Nepotism: Putting her nephew in charge of which business have to shut down and which ones don‚Äôt (he has been caught allowing attractive female business owners to remain open just because of their looks)

- Holding weekly press conferences about the virus and throwing a fit and yelling at a cameraman on live television when she wasn‚Äôt centered on the screen

- Limiting grocery stores to 75 people per store, and shutting down grocery stores in small towns that don‚Äôt comply, forcing residents of small towns to drive to the bigger cities to get groceries. Then, when called out about the multi-hour long lines that formed outside of grocery stores around thanksgiving, said that there were no lines and that it was just ‚Äúrepublican propaganda‚Äù

- Started a snitch line and encouraged New Mexicans to report each other for lockdown violations, using the state police as her private SS to enforce those laws and investigate claims made on the snitch line. 

- Had the fire martial go around from church to church fining people for having too large of groups or not wearing masks. How is that the responsibility of the fire martial? 

- Unlike in other states, such as Michigan, the State Supreme Court has not only not kept her in check, but has upheld and supported her unconstitutional executive orders. 

She really has earned the nickname

What a fiscal conservative would do would be tell the rest of the world sorry, we don‚Äôt have a penny for you this year, in fact, we‚Äôre never going to have money for you again, do a stimulus for the people of this country and then work to open the economy so we don‚Äôt have to do this again.

It allows people who don't have a lot of money right now to spend money on things.  This allows businesses to make money which in turn allows businesses to keep their employees which keeps people paid which keeps our economy moving.  

Big business doesn't need aid.  Airlines don't need aid.  Billion dollar corporations don't need aid.  Small businesses need aid.  Regular people need aid.  Regular people need stimulus to help small business stay in business.  Stop giving money to large corporations who just use it to line their pockets.

Republicans need to loose in Georgia. I'm sorry, but it needs to happen. If it doesn't, if conservatives don't learn that there are very real consequences to not having a spine, then the left will slowly win inch by inch over the next hundred years or so. By the time we get to the point where it's bad enough for people to wake up, there won't be anyone who remembers what a free America was like.

I think if there's a massive uprooting today, we can win and bring back at least some sanity. If it doesn't happen for another few decades, I think it will be permanent. It needs to happen sooner rather than later, and if we win Georgia, conservatives will be perfectly happy to kick the can a little further.***If this is you, don‚Äôt, do NOT freaking do this.

TL;DR: there are insidious social and political effects to propagandizing for soldiers and war that is three generations old while ignoring the soldiers of other wars. Weert's is out of touch. I have personal experience as well as reasons rooted in political and social observation for these opinions.

They performed their duty. That's good.

The problem is the three plus generations of incessant pedestalization after the WWII (which other veterans of other wars didn't get), is more or less 100% to use them as them as anti Right Wing bulwark extending well into Left Wing points that the vast majority of these soldiers would have never agreed with.

In modern propaganda, the implication anymore isn't that these soldeirs were only fighting a great evil.

Its that they were essentially for the opposite politics of globalization and extreme social liberalism. It's dishonest but that's what the implication has become.

See the now-common Antifa self-association with WWII soldiers.

See that the Leftist media demonstrates their popular thought control ability when they make ""the Greatest generation"" into multi-generational heroes and cause Vietnam Veterans to be widely loathed in their time solely due to the political nature of the enemies that these two wars were against.

The American Press are communist sympathizers and essentially became an embedded CCP propaganda stream against our Vietnam soldeirs.

Why conform to the press's propaganda intent?

Its not like this generation hasn't had its time in the Sun. They more than have. You aren't taking anything away by moving on.

Even if that act of moving on is the same time and money simply to recognize more recent soldiers of more recent wars.

The three plus generations of propaganda also has other insidious effects. Like causing young men to be over-enthusaistic about joining the military (can be good, but only with a clear mind in regard to what it is).

Which I have seen in my own family and is the reason that my Father died young. He joined the wrong branch of the military, in the wrong war, in order to try to measure up to the incessant light being shone on his Father. Light that became malignant. The wrong military experience can ruin a family for generations.

My grandfather having marched across Europe. Losing friends just like Weert's (the article author's) father. It's largely a mirror story to hers.

My grandfather was a good man and my friend. He was popular, in fact, and for good reasons. I miss him every day. I'm the one who tends to his still living wife.

But he dined out on this three generations of propaganda pedestalizing of his service and generation until he died at 95.

I was mostly very congratulatory with the general zeitgeist, and even in awe when younger (per the proapganda intent) but over time it became exhausting and frustrating. It also wasn't appropriate for a man with a sober mind in my opinion.

I would have much rather him put less energy into celebrating himself, and had less sympathy toward the implied social liberalism that the quasi-fame came attached to as its cost, and he have been more steely eyed in regard to raising his kids who had mixed to bad outcomes as a result of their generational trauma and liberalism that my grandfather's father would have never allowed.

So, enough with these articles. There are millions of them to reference already, in addition to books and films. I get Weert's nostalgia. I get her need to give her Father a little bit of fame.

But its misplaced and late for public consumption. It should be a family process at this point in history.

Or reduce the number of stores to 1 and force 600 people to breath the same air.  Seems pretty simple to me.    

Small business closure was just a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy.  

Stimulus is forcing the middle class to supplement the poor.....giving someone $600 a week...who originally made $400 a week....happy camper.  Giving someone $600 a week that originally made $1500 a week...forcing them to deplete any savings creating another shifting of wealth.

The small business that shuttered bc of a sudden and dramatic shift in landscape, in a free market, should close. Like a fire in a forrest, in a free market, new businesses will explode to compete and fill demand.

In a free market, we can and should still take care of the citizens who were working for or created a businesses that suffered greatly, the question is how best do we support them.

For example, where I live, we are not under lock down,
My favorite pizza shop, run by a normal citizen closed and they auctioned off their equipment.
The store closed not bc of a competitor, there are no other pizza shops near us.
They closed bc demand was so low the business couldn‚Äôt stay open.
That store owner isnt going to lose his experience in how to run a small business and isnt likely going to change trades.

Last year/a few months ago, the Left pushed for a No Bail system.  You get arrested and then you are released before the arresting officer has finished the paperwork.  One of the ""victims"" the Left championed in this was a career bicycle thief who was arrested for stealing a bicycle and his bail was something like $20,000.  He became one of the champions to get rid of bail.  The Right should have challenged this.  Posted a response video of his victims, the people who had their bikes stolen by this career criminal and ask the Democrats why they are concerned with the criminal and not his victims, and make sure the video showed his victims weren't just white people, but a diverse set of victims.  They should have asked why we should care about a bicycle thief being in prison.  But no, the Left makes their dumbass claims and the Right doesn't challenge any of it.  Even now as crime is running rampant in a New York City with no bail, the Republicans are silent when they could be telling the victims of the Democrat's failed policies ""Vote us back in and we'll not just reinstate bail, we'll increase it.""

Morality is a good thing, but when you don't have a spine or a pair of balls, morality just makes you look weak when your opponents are willing to use every dirty trick in the book to win.  That is the lesson that needs to be remembered.  When the opposing party is willing to lie, cheat, steal, and take away the rights of the citizens once they take over, handing this nation and it's tax dollars to those who enter this nation illegally, morality needs to be backed up with something to counter the lying, cheating and the stealing.  I hate saying it, I don't like the idea, but the fact of the matter is that in the 2020 election the Right played by the rules, the Left did not and the courts refused to allow the Right to challenge the results, to bring in the evidence to prove that we were robbed.

A bag of presents was on the tarmac between the two groups. The banner was put away amid much well-wishing for the boy. The bag of presents was picked up.

>The mistrust they are sowing is depressing turnout.

Legislators sowing mistrust in Georgia's electoral process, when colleagues have gone further than any swing state (both by law and voluntarily) to test the reliability of voting and ballot process, is unwarrantedly toxic for Republican prospects in the Senate. And it's even more baffling that, in doing this, they're...

>...calling their own re-elections illegitimate.***He‚Äôs scared***I don't see anything in this ""fact check"" addressing the claims and evidence presented. 

Is character assassination all they have left? How is ignoring the evidence and personally attacking and threatening the people bringing the evidence to light any different from what has been the core tactic thus far?***FACT CHECK: GEORGIA SENATE MASQUERADES FAILED TREASURE HUNTER AS HACKER AND ELECTION SECURITY EXPERT

(ATLANTA)-Yesterday, during a Georgia State Senate hearing, failed treasure hunter, J. Hutton Pulitzer, or Commander Pulitzer (no record of military experience), claimed that he had ‚Äúhacked‚Äù Georgia‚Äôs voting system. The treasure hunter provided no evidence during the Senate hearing that he had done so, only claiming it had happened.

‚ÄúFake news is hard enough to combat when mainstream media outlets push it out, but when a small cadre of Georgia legislators do it, it‚Äôs a whole different story,‚Äù said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. ‚ÄúThese legislators need to stop calling their own reelections illegitimate and focus on getting out the vote for the January 5 elections. The mistrust they are sowing is depressing turnout. If Senators Loeffler and Perdue lose on January 5, the Georgia state legislators have only themselves to blame.‚Äù

In another election disinformation filled hearing, a small group of Republicans in the Georgia State Senate featured the claims of failed inventor and failed treasure hunter J. Hutton Pulitzer as a star witness. In his presentation, Hutton Pulitzer, formerly J. Jovan Philylaw, claimed without providing any evidence that he had ‚Äúhacked‚Äù a poll pad. He then went on to claim that meant that the entire voting system was compromised even though the poll pad, like the poll books which they have replaced, are never connected to the rest of the voting system.

Hutton Pulitzer was the inventor of CueCat, a cat shaped device that, when connected to the computer, allowed users to scan barcodes on ads that would bring up the website where they could purchase the advertised product. The device attracted $185 million in investment before becoming ‚Äúan anathema of the tech industry and a cautionary tale for investors.‚Äù In 2006, is was listed as one of the ‚Äú25 worst tech products of all time‚Äù by PC World magazine.

Hutton Pulitzer later became a treasure hunter, searching unsuccessfully for the Ark of the Covenant and later claiming that a sword, that was likely a fake, not only had ‚Äú‚Äòmagical‚Äô magnetic properties‚Äù but was also a sign that ancient Romans had visited North America by 200 A.D.

His published work is comprised largely of ‚ÄúCommanders Lost Treasures‚Äù books, a separate one for many states in the U.S., and includes ‚ÄúHow to Cut Off Your Arm and Eat Your Dog.‚Äù

Despite Hutton‚Äôs claims, the Poll Pads are the only piece of election infrastructure that is every hooked up to the internet or connected to devices that are hooked up to the internet. The poll pads have that capability so election workers can download updated voter lists to the poll pads that are used to check people in on Election Day. However, the Wifi capability is disabled before the poll pads are put in to use at the polling place.

Additionally, the touch screen interfaces and attached printers are never attached to the poll pads and are air-gapped so they cannot be connected to the internet. Finally, the scanners, which scan and tabulate the printed paper ballots that voters can review before casting, are not connected to any of the other equipment at any point either.

In a statement, poll pad creator KnowInk said: ‚ÄúThe assertions made about unauthorized access to our systems are patently false. The man claiming that someone ‚Äògot into‚Äô our systems did not happen according to our forensic analysis. There was no ‚Äòhack,‚Äô there was no ‚Äòback door‚Äô entry, there was no ‚Äòpump and dump,‚Äô and there was no access through a ‚Äòthermostat‚Äô located hundreds of miles away in Savannah.‚Äù

Georgia is recognized as a national leader in elections. It was the first state in the country to implement the trifecta of automatic voter registration, at least 16 days of early voting (which has been called the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù), and no-excuse absentee voting. Georgia continues to set records for voter turnout and election participation, seeing the largest increase in average turnout of any other state in the 2018 midterm election and record turnout in 2020, with over 1.3 million absentee by mail voters and over 3.6 million in-person voters utilizing Georgia‚Äôs new, secure, paper ballot voting system.

1) Didn't Trump say he would sign the Bill for $2k per person IF certain redline items were removed?

2) Didn't the House Dems just add to the Bill and left all the pork (redline items) in?

3) If 1 and 2 are true....then why is everyone bashing on Senate Reps for not voting for all the pork? Even Trump is bashing them, why? Again, if 1 and 2 are correct.

4) is there a separate bill for just the $2k that I missed? Or is this bill that the Senate keeps pushing back on the same pork-filled bill??

As much as I know there are families, small businesses,  and many more that need that $2K....like last week....is it worth seeing all that $$$ being sent out if the US to help other countries?

These  people don't know what they are saying, and they are letting their anger dictate what they say and do.

These are the kind of people who end up in prison and get beat up on day 1 because they want so badly to be ""the tough guy"" that they just think their way into believing that they know how to fight, when they have no idea.

To be clear, I'm not some tough guy, but I've been in the military and used to work at a prison.  I never started fights, and I was never quick to ""lay down the law"" because most of the time, someone who actually is big and bad can be reasoned with, and a person who is a fake tough guy is easily scared with paperwork, which is the proper thing to do in a prison or the military anyway.  

There does need to be more of socially acceptable system to allow young men to prove themselves in some sort of combat fashion, like a boxing gym, kickboxing, or wrestling matches or something.

Off market sales are commonplace in luxury real estate, especially when the seller has a public persona. 


I‚Äôve always listed my homes above seller appraisal price and never had a problem selling. Appraisals are useless. I‚Äôve never had a post-contract appraisal ever come in lower than the contract price.***Come on guys it's just a normal transferrance of a non-liquid asset***Well, let's take a minute and look at this. First, off market sales or so called 'pocket listings' happen all the time. Second, an appraiser and one real estate agent supported the value. Others had opinions ranging from 'a few thousand dollars' to something in the $140k range.  That's less than 10% of the sales price for the agent with the biggest difference.  Additionally it wouldn't be uncommon for the buyer to offer a higher price to avoid the house being listed on the MLS and have to potentially compete with other buyers. 

On the surface the connection between Perdue and the buyer looks bad and the article was written to imply that this the sale was handled improperly.  Unfortunately they offer no real proof.

There's a lot of hesitance around vaccination across the political spectrum though.  Any sort of attempt at a mandate will be not only on shaky legal ground but will be a huge political nightmare.
